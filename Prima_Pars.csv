","Whether, besides Philosophy, any Further Doctrine Is Required?
"," It seems that, besides philosophical science, we have no
 need of any further knowledge. For man should not seek to know what is
 above reason: ""Seek not the things that are too high for thee""
 (Ecclus. 3:22). But whatever is not above reason is fully treated of
 in philosophical science. Therefore any other knowledge besides
 philosophical science is superfluous.
"," Further, knowledge can be concerned only with being, for
 nothing can be known, save what is true; and all that is, is true. But
 everything that is, is treated of in philosophical science--even God
 Himself; so that there is a part of philosophy called theology, or the
 divine science, as Aristotle has proved (Metaph. vi). Therefore,
 besides philosophical science, there is no need of any further
 knowledge.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Although those things which are beyond man's
 knowledge may not be sought for by man through his reason,
 nevertheless, once they are revealed by God, they must be accepted by
 faith. Hence the sacred text continues, ""For many things are shown to
 thee above the understanding of man"" (Ecclus. 3:25). And in this, the
 sacred science consists.
"," Sciences are differentiated according to the
 various means through which knowledge is obtained. For the astronomer
 and the physicist both may prove the same conclusion: that the earth,
 for instance, is round: the astronomer by means of mathematics (i.e.
 abstracting from matter), but the physicist by means of matter itself.
 Hence there is no reason why those things which may be learned from
 philosophical science, so far as they can be known by natural reason,
 may not also be taught us by another science so far as they fall
 within revelation. Hence theology included in sacred doctrine differs
 in kind from that theology which is part of philosophy.

1,"[I, Q. 1, Art. 2]
","Whether Sacred Doctrine Is a Science?
"," It seems that sacred doctrine is not a science. For every
 science proceeds from self-evident principles. But sacred doctrine
 proceeds from articles of faith which are not self-evident, since
 their truth is not admitted by all: ""For all men have not faith"" (2
 Thess. 3:2). Therefore sacred doctrine is not a science.
"," Further, no science deals with individual facts. But this
 sacred science treats of individual facts, such as the deeds of
 Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and such like. Therefore sacred doctrine is
 not a science.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The principles of any science are either in
 themselves self-evident, or reducible to the conclusions of a higher
 science; and such, as we have said, are the principles of sacred
 doctrine.
"," Individual facts are treated of in sacred
 doctrine, not because it is concerned with them principally, but they
 are introduced rather both as examples to be followed in our lives (as
 in moral sciences) and in order to establish the authority of those
 men through whom the divine revelation, on which this sacred scripture
 or doctrine is based, has come down to us.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,"[I, Q. 1, Art. 3]
","Whether Sacred Doctrine Is One Science?
"," It seems that sacred doctrine is not one science; for
 according to the Philosopher (Poster. i) ""that science is one which
 treats only of one class of subjects."" But the creator and the
 creature, both of whom are treated of in sacred doctrine, cannot be
 grouped together under one class of subjects. Therefore sacred
 doctrine is not one science.
"," Further, in sacred doctrine we treat of angels, corporeal
 creatures and human morality. But these belong to separate
 philosophical sciences. Therefore sacred doctrine cannot be one
 science.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Sacred doctrine does not treat of God and
 creatures equally, but of God primarily, and of creatures only so far
 as they are referable to God as their beginning or end. Hence the
 unity of this science is not impaired.
"," Nothing prevents inferior faculties or habits
 from being differentiated by something which falls under a higher
 faculty or habit as well; because the higher faculty or habit regards
 the object in its more universal formality, as the object of the
 common sense is whatever affects the senses, including, therefore,
 whatever is visible or audible. Hence the common sense, although one
 faculty, extends to all the objects of the five senses. Similarly,
 objects which are the subject-matter of different philosophical
 sciences can yet be treated of by this one single sacred science under
 one aspect precisely so far as they can be included in revelation. So
 that in this way, sacred doctrine bears, as it were, the stamp of the
 divine science which is one and simple, yet extends to everything.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,"[I, Q. 1, Art. 4]
","Whether Sacred Doctrine Is a Practical Science?
"," It seems that sacred doctrine is a practical science; for
 a practical science is that which ends in action according to the
 Philosopher (Metaph. ii). But sacred doctrine is ordained to action:
 ""Be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only"" (James 1:22).
 Therefore sacred doctrine is a practical science.
"," Further, sacred doctrine is divided into the Old and the
 New Law. But law implies a moral science which is a practical science.
 Therefore sacred doctrine is a practical science.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,"[I, Q. 1, Art. 5]
","Whether Sacred Doctrine Is Nobler than Other Sciences?
"," It seems that sacred doctrine is not nobler than other
 sciences; for the nobility of a science depends on the certitude it
 establishes. But other sciences, the principles of which cannot be
 doubted, seem to be more certain than sacred doctrine; for its
 principles--namely, articles of faith--can be doubted. Therefore
 other sciences seem to be nobler.
"," Further, it is the sign of a lower science to depend upon
 a higher; as music depends on arithmetic. But sacred doctrine does in
 a sense depend upon philosophical sciences; for Jerome observes, in
 his Epistle to Magnus, that ""the ancient doctors so enriched their
 books with the ideas and phrases of the philosophers, that thou
 knowest not what more to admire in them, their profane erudition or
 their scriptural learning."" Therefore sacred doctrine is inferior to
 other sciences.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,," It may well happen that what is in itself the
 more certain may seem to us the less certain on account of the
 weakness of our intelligence, ""which is dazzled by the clearest
 objects of nature; as the owl is dazzled by the light of the sun""
 (Metaph. ii, lect. i). Hence the fact that some happen to doubt about
 articles of faith is not due to the uncertain nature of the truths,
 but to the weakness of human intelligence; yet the slenderest
 knowledge that may be obtained of the highest things is more desirable
 than the most certain knowledge obtained of lesser things, as is said
 in de Animalibus xi.
"," This science can in a sense depend upon the
 philosophical sciences, not as though it stood in need of them, but
 only in order to make its teaching clearer. For it accepts its
 principles not from other sciences, but immediately from God, by
 revelation. Therefore it does not depend upon other sciences as upon
 the higher, but makes use of them as of the lesser, and as
 handmaidens: even so the master sciences make use of the sciences that
 supply their materials, as political of military science. That it thus
 uses them is not due to its own defect or insufficiency, but to the
 defect of our intelligence, which is more easily led by what is known
 through natural reason (from which proceed the other sciences) to that
 which is above reason, such as are the teachings of this science.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,"[I, Q. 1, Art. 6]
","Whether This Doctrine Is the Same as Wisdom?
"," It seems that this doctrine is not the same as wisdom.
 For no doctrine which borrows its principles is worthy of the name of
 wisdom; seeing that the wise man directs, and is not directed (Metaph.
 i). But this doctrine borrows its principles. Therefore this science
 is not wisdom.
"," Further, it is a part of wisdom to prove the principles
 of other sciences. Hence it is called the chief of sciences, as is
 clear in Ethic. vi. But this doctrine does not prove the principles of
 other sciences. Therefore it is not the same as wisdom.
"," Further, this doctrine is acquired by study, whereas
 wisdom is acquired by God's inspiration; so that it is numbered among
 the gifts of the Holy Spirit (Isa. 11:2). Therefore this doctrine is
 not the same as wisdom.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Sacred doctrine derives its principles not from
 any human knowledge, but from the divine knowledge, through which, as
 through the highest wisdom, all our knowledge is set in order.
"," The principles of other sciences either are
 evident and cannot be proved, or are proved by natural reason through
 some other science. But the knowledge proper to this science comes
 through revelation and not through natural reason. Therefore it has no
 concern to prove the principles of other sciences, but only to judge
 of them. Whatsoever is found in other sciences contrary to any truth
 of this science must be condemned as false: ""Destroying counsels and
 every height that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God"" (2
 Cor. 10:4, 5).
"," Since judgment appertains to wisdom, the twofold
 manner of judging produces a twofold wisdom. A man may judge in one
 way by inclination, as whoever has the habit of a virtue judges
 rightly of what concerns that virtue by his very inclination towards
 it. Hence it is the virtuous man, as we read, who is the measure and
 rule of human acts. In another way, by knowledge, just as a man
 learned in moral science might be able to judge rightly about virtuous
 acts, though he had not the virtue. The first manner of judging divine
 things belongs to that wisdom which is set down among the gifts of the
 Holy Ghost: ""The spiritual man judgeth all things"" (1 Cor. 2:15). And
 Dionysius says (Div. Nom. ii): ""Hierotheus is taught not by mere
 learning, but by experience of divine things."" The second manner of
 judging belongs to this doctrine which is acquired by study, though
 its principles are obtained by revelation.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,"[I, Q. 1, Art. 7]
","Whether God Is the Object of This Science?
"," It seems that God is not the object of this science. For
 in every science, the nature of its object is presupposed. But this
 science cannot presuppose the essence of God, for Damascene says (De
 Fide Orth. i, iv): ""It is impossible to define the essence of God.""
 Therefore God is not the object of this science.
"," Further, whatever conclusions are reached in any science
 must be comprehended under the object of the science. But in Holy Writ
 we reach conclusions not only concerning God, but concerning many
 other things, such as creatures and human morality. Therefore God is
 not the object of this science.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Although we cannot know in what consists the
 essence of God, nevertheless in this science we make use of His
 effects, either of nature or of grace, in place of a definition, in
 regard to whatever is treated of in this science concerning God; even
 as in some philosophical sciences we demonstrate something about a
 cause from its effect, by taking the effect in place of a definition
 of the cause.
"," Whatever other conclusions are reached in this
 sacred science are comprehended under God, not as parts or species or
 accidents but as in some way related to Him.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,"[I, Q. 1, Art. 8]
","Whether Sacred Doctrine is a Matter of Argument?
"," It seems this doctrine is not a matter of argument. For
 Ambrose says (De Fide 1): ""Put arguments aside where faith is sought.""
 But in this doctrine, faith especially is sought: ""But these things
 are written that you may believe"" (John 20:31). Therefore sacred
 doctrine is not a matter of argument.
"," Further, if it is a matter of argument, the argument is
 either from authority or from reason. If it is from authority, it
 seems unbefitting its dignity, for the proof from authority is the
 weakest form of proof. But if it is from reason, this is unbefitting
 its end, because, according to Gregory (Hom. 26), ""faith has no merit
 in those things of which human reason brings its own experience.""
 Therefore sacred doctrine is not a matter of argument.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Although arguments from human reason cannot
 avail to prove what must be received on faith, nevertheless, this
 doctrine argues from articles of faith to other truths.
"," This doctrine is especially based upon arguments
 from authority, inasmuch as its principles are obtained by revelation:
 thus we ought to believe on the authority of those to whom the
 revelation has been made. Nor does this take away from the dignity of
 this doctrine, for although the argument from authority based on human
 reason is the weakest, yet the argument from authority based on divine
 revelation is the strongest. But sacred doctrine makes use even of
 human reason, not, indeed, to prove faith (for thereby the merit of
 faith would come to an end), but to make clear other things that are
 put forward in this doctrine. Since therefore grace does not destroy
 nature but perfects it, natural reason should minister to faith as the
 natural bent of the will ministers to charity. Hence the Apostle says:
 ""Bringing into captivity every understanding unto the obedience of
 Christ"" (2 Cor. 10:5). Hence sacred doctrine makes use also of the
 authority of philosophers in those questions in which they were able
 to know the truth by natural reason, as Paul quotes a saying of
 Aratus: ""As some also of your own poets said: For we are also His
 offspring"" (Acts 17:28). Nevertheless, sacred doctrine makes use of
 these authorities as extrinsic and probable arguments; but properly
 uses the authority of the canonical Scriptures as an incontrovertible
 proof, and the authority of the doctors of the Church as one that may
 properly be used, yet merely as probable. For our faith rests upon the
 revelation made to the apostles and prophets who wrote the canonical
 books, and not on the revelations (if any such there are) made to
 other doctors. Hence Augustine says (Epis. ad Hieron. xix, 1): ""Only
 those books of Scripture which are called canonical have I learned to
 hold in such honor as to believe their authors have not erred in any
 way in writing them. But other authors I so read as not to deem
 everything in their works to be true, merely on account of their
 having so thought and written, whatever may have been their holiness
 and learning.""
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,"[I, Q. 1, Art. 9]
","Whether Holy Scripture Should Use Metaphors?
"," It seems that Holy Scripture should not use metaphors.
 For that which is proper to the lowest science seems not to befit this
 science, which holds the highest place of all. But to proceed by the
 aid of various similitudes and figures is proper to poetry, the least
 of all the sciences. Therefore it is not fitting that this science
 should make use of such similitudes.
"," Further, this doctrine seems to be intended to make truth
 clear. Hence a reward is held out to those who manifest it: ""They that
 explain me shall have life everlasting"" (Ecclus. 24:31). But by such
 similitudes truth is obscured. Therefore, to put forward divine truths
 by likening them to corporeal things does not befit this science.
"," Further, the higher creatures are, the nearer they
 approach to the divine likeness. If therefore any creature be taken to
 represent God, this representation ought chiefly to be taken from the
 higher creatures, and not from the lower; yet this is often found in
 Scriptures.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Poetry makes use of metaphors to produce a
 representation, for it is natural to man to be pleased with
 representations. But sacred doctrine makes use of metaphors as both
 necessary and useful.
"," The ray of divine revelation is not extinguished
 by the sensible imagery wherewith it is veiled, as Dionysius says
 (Coel. Hier. i); and its truth so far remains that it does not allow
 the minds of those to whom the revelation has been made, to rest in
 the metaphors, but raises them to the knowledge of truths; and through
 those to whom the revelation has been made others also may receive
 instruction in these matters. Hence those things that are taught
 metaphorically in one part of Scripture, in other parts are taught
 more openly. The very hiding of truth in figures is useful for the
 exercise of thoughtful minds and as a defense against the ridicule of
 the impious, according to the words ""Give not that which is holy to
 dogs"" (Matt. 7:6).
"," As Dionysius says, (Coel. Hier. i) it is more
 fitting that divine truths should be expounded under the figure of
 less noble than of nobler bodies, and this for three reasons. Firstly,
 because thereby men's minds are the better preserved from error. For
 then it is clear that these things are not literal descriptions of
 divine truths, which might have been open to doubt had they been
 expressed under the figure of nobler bodies, especially for those who
 could think of nothing nobler than bodies. Secondly, because this is
 more befitting the knowledge of God that we have in this life. For
 what He is not is clearer to us than what He is. Therefore similitudes
 drawn from things farthest away from God form within us a truer
 estimate that God is above whatsoever we may say or think of Him.
 Thirdly, because thereby divine truths are the better hidden from the
 unworthy.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,"[I, Q. 1, Art. 10]
","Whether in Holy Scripture a Word may have Several Senses?
"," It seems that in Holy Writ a word cannot have several
 senses, historical or literal, allegorical, tropological or moral, and
 anagogical. For many different senses in one text produce confusion
 and deception and destroy all force of argument. Hence no argument,
 but only fallacies, can be deduced from a multiplicity of
 propositions. But Holy Writ ought to be able to state the truth
 without any fallacy. Therefore in it there cannot be several senses to
 a word.
"," Further, Augustine says (De util. cred. iii) that ""the
 Old Testament has a fourfold division as to history, etiology, analogy
 and allegory."" Now these four seem altogether different from the four
 divisions mentioned in the first objection. Therefore it does not seem
 fitting to explain the same word of Holy Writ according to the four
 different senses mentioned above.
"," Further, besides these senses, there is the parabolical,
 which is not one of these four.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The multiplicity of these senses does not
 produce equivocation or any other kind of multiplicity, seeing that
 these senses are not multiplied because one word signifies several
 things, but because the things signified by the words can be
 themselves types of other things. Thus in Holy Writ no confusion
 results, for all the senses are founded on one--the literal--from
 which alone can any argument be drawn, and not from those intended in
 allegory, as Augustine says (Epis. 48). Nevertheless, nothing of Holy
 Scripture perishes on account of this, since nothing necessary to
 faith is contained under the spiritual sense which is not elsewhere
 put forward by the Scripture in its literal sense.
"," These three--history, etiology, analogy--are
 grouped under the literal sense. For it is called history, as
 Augustine expounds (Epis. 48), whenever anything is simply related; it
 is called etiology when its cause is assigned, as when Our Lord gave
 the reason why Moses allowed the putting away of wives--namely, on
 account of the hardness of men's hearts; it is called analogy whenever
 the truth of one text of Scripture is shown not to contradict the
 truth of another. Of these four, allegory alone stands for the three
 spiritual senses. Thus Hugh of St. Victor (Sacram. iv, 4 Prolog.)
 includes the anagogical under the allegorical sense, laying down three
 senses only--the historical, the allegorical, and the tropological.
"," The parabolical sense is contained in the
 literal, for by words things are signified properly and figuratively.
 Nor is the figure itself, but that which is figured, the literal
 sense. When Scripture speaks of God's arm, the literal sense is not
 that God has such a member, but only what is signified by this member,
 namely operative power. Hence it is plain that nothing false can ever
 underlie the literal sense of Holy Writ.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,"[I, Q. 2, Art. 1]
","Whether the Existence of God Is Self-Evident?
"," It seems that the existence of God is self-evident. Now
 those things are said to be self-evident to us the knowledge of which
 is naturally implanted in us, as we can see in regard to first
 principles. But as Damascene says (De Fide Orth. i, 1,3), ""the
 knowledge of God is naturally implanted in all."" Therefore the
 existence of God is self-evident.
"," Further, those things are said to be self-evident which
 are known as soon as the terms are known, which the Philosopher (1
 Poster. iii) says is true of the first principles of demonstration.
 Thus, when the nature of a whole and of a part is known, it is at once
 recognized that every whole is greater than its part. But as soon as
 the signification of the word ""God"" is understood, it is at once seen
 that God exists. For by this word is signified that thing than which
 nothing greater can be conceived. But that which exists actually and
 mentally is greater than that which exists only mentally. Therefore,
 since as soon as the word ""God"" is understood it exists mentally, it
 also follows that it exists actually. Therefore the proposition ""God
 exists"" is self-evident.
"," Further, the existence of truth is self-evident. For
 whoever denies the existence of truth grants that truth does not
 exist: and, if truth does not exist, then the proposition ""Truth does
 not exist"" is true: and if there is anything true, there must be
 truth. But God is truth itself: ""I am the way, the truth, and the
 life"" (John 14:6) Therefore ""God exists"" is self-evident.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," To know that God exists in a general and
 confused way is implanted in us by nature, inasmuch as God is man's
 beatitude. For man naturally desires happiness, and what is naturally
 desired by man must be naturally known to him. This, however, is not
 to know absolutely that God exists; just as to know that someone is
 approaching is not the same as to know that Peter is approaching, even
 though it is Peter who is approaching; for many there are who imagine
 that man's perfect good which is happiness, consists in riches, and
 others in pleasures, and others in something else.
"," Perhaps not everyone who hears this word ""God""
 understands it to signify something than which nothing greater can be
 thought, seeing that some have believed God to be a body. Yet, granted
 that everyone understands that by this word ""God"" is signified
 something than which nothing greater can be thought, nevertheless, it
 does not therefore follow that he understands that what the word
 signifies exists actually, but only that it exists mentally. Nor can
 it be argued that it actually exists, unless it be admitted that there
 actually exists something than which nothing greater can be thought;
 and this precisely is not admitted by those who hold that God does not
 exist.
"," The existence of truth in general is
 self-evident but the existence of a Primal Truth is not self-evident
 to us.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,"[I, Q. 2, Art. 2]
","Whether It Can Be Demonstrated That God Exists?
"," It seems that the existence of God cannot be
 demonstrated. For it is an article of faith that God exists. But what
 is of faith cannot be demonstrated, because a demonstration produces
 scientific knowledge; whereas faith is of the unseen (Heb. 11:1).
 Therefore it cannot be demonstrated that God exists.
"," Further, the essence is the middle term of demonstration.
 But we cannot know in what God's essence consists, but solely in what
 it does not consist; as Damascene says (De Fide Orth. i, 4). Therefore
 we cannot demonstrate that God exists.
"," Further, if the existence of God were demonstrated, this
 could only be from His effects. But His effects are not proportionate
 to Him, since He is infinite and His effects are finite; and between
 the finite and infinite there is no proportion. Therefore, since a
 cause cannot be demonstrated by an effect not proportionate to it, it
 seems that the existence of God cannot be demonstrated.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The existence of God and other like truths about
 God, which can be known by natural reason, are not articles of faith,
 but are preambles to the articles; for faith presupposes natural
 knowledge, even as grace presupposes nature, and perfection supposes
 something that can be perfected. Nevertheless, there is nothing to
 prevent a man, who cannot grasp a proof, accepting, as a matter of
 faith, something which in itself is capable of being scientifically
 known and demonstrated.
"," When the existence of a cause is demonstrated
 from an effect, this effect takes the place of the definition of the
 cause in proof of the cause's existence. This is especially the case
 in regard to God, because, in order to prove the existence of
 anything, it is necessary to accept as a middle term the meaning of
 the word, and not its essence, for the question of its essence follows
 on the question of its existence. Now the names given to God are
 derived from His effects; consequently, in demonstrating the existence
 of God from His effects, we may take for the middle term the meaning
 of the word ""God"".
"," From effects not proportionate to the cause no
 perfect knowledge of that cause can be obtained. Yet from every effect
 the existence of the cause can be clearly demonstrated, and so we can
 demonstrate the existence of God from His effects; though from them we
 cannot perfectly know God as He is in His essence.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,"[I, Q. 2, Art. 3]
","Whether God Exists?
"," It seems that God does not exist; because if one of two
 contraries be infinite, the other would be altogether destroyed. But
 the word ""God"" means that He is infinite goodness. If, therefore, God
 existed, there would be no evil discoverable; but there is evil in the
 world. Therefore God does not exist.
"," Further, it is superfluous to suppose that what can be
 accounted for by a few principles has been produced by many. But it
 seems that everything we see in the world can be accounted for by
 other principles, supposing God did not exist. For all natural things
 can be reduced to one principle which is nature; and all voluntary
 things can be reduced to one principle which is human reason, or will.
 Therefore there is no need to suppose God's existence.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,," As Augustine says (Enchiridion xi): ""Since God
 is the highest good, He would not allow any evil to exist in His
 works, unless His omnipotence and goodness were such as to bring good
 even out of evil."" This is part of the infinite goodness of God, that
 He should allow evil to exist, and out of it produce good.
"," Since nature works for a determinate end under
 the direction of a higher agent, whatever is done by nature must needs
 be traced back to God, as to its first cause. So also whatever is done
 voluntarily must also be traced back to some higher cause other than
 human reason or will, since these can change or fail; for all things
 that are changeable and capable of defect must be traced back to an
 immovable and self-necessary first principle, as was shown in the body
 of the Article.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13,"[I, Q. 3, Art. 1]
","Whether God Is a Body?
"," It seems that God is a body. For a body is that which has
 the three dimensions. But Holy Scripture attributes the three
 dimensions to God, for it is written: ""He is higher than Heaven, and
 what wilt thou do? He is deeper than Hell, and how wilt thou know? The
 measure of Him is longer than the earth and broader than the sea"" (Job
 11:8, 9). Therefore God is a body.
"," Further, everything that has figure is a body, since
 figure is a quality of quantity. But God seems to have figure, for it
 is written: ""Let us make man to our image and likeness"" (Gen. 1:26).
 Now a figure is called an image, according to the text: ""Who being the
 brightness of His glory and the figure,"" i.e. the image, ""of His
 substance"" (Heb. 1:3). Therefore God is a body.
"," Further, whatever has corporeal parts is a body. Now
 Scripture attributes corporeal parts to God. ""Hast thou an arm like
 God?"" (Job 40:4); and ""The eyes of the Lord are upon the just"" (Ps.
 33:16); and ""The right hand of the Lord hath wrought strength"" (Ps.
 117:16). Therefore God is a body.
"," Further, posture belongs only to bodies. But something
 which supposes posture is said of God in the Scriptures: ""I saw the
 Lord sitting"" (Isa. 6:1), and ""He standeth up to judge"" (Isa. 3:13).
 Therefore God is a body.
"," Further, only bodies or things corporeal can be a local
 term wherefrom or whereto. But in the Scriptures God is spoken of
 as a local term whereto, according to the words, ""Come ye to Him and
 be enlightened"" (Ps. 33:6), and as a term wherefrom: ""All they that
 depart from Thee shall be written in the earth"" (Jer. 17:13).
 Therefore God is a body.
",,,,,,,,,,,,," As we have said above (Q. 1, A. 9), Holy Writ
 puts before us spiritual and divine things under the comparison of
 corporeal things. Hence, when it attributes to God the three
 dimensions under the comparison of corporeal quantity, it implies His
 virtual quantity; thus, by depth, it signifies His power of knowing
 hidden things; by height, the transcendence of His excelling power; by
 length, the duration of His existence; by breadth, His act of love for
 all. Or, as says Dionysius (Div. Nom. ix), by the depth of God is
 meant the incomprehensibility of His essence; by length, the
 procession of His all-pervading power; by breadth, His overspreading
 all things, inasmuch as all things lie under His protection.
"," Man is said to be after the image of God, not as
 regards his body, but as regards that whereby he excels other animals.
 Hence, when it is said, ""Let us make man to our image and likeness"",
 it is added, ""And let him have dominion over the fishes of the sea""
 (Gen. 1:26). Now man excels all animals by his reason and intelligence;
 hence it is according to his intelligence and reason, which are
 incorporeal, that man is said to be according to the image of God.
"," Corporeal parts are attributed to God in
 Scripture on account of His actions, and this is owing to a certain
 parallel. For instance the act of the eye is to see; hence the eye
 attributed to God signifies His power of seeing intellectually, not
 sensibly; and so on with the other parts.
"," Whatever pertains to posture, also, is only
 attributed to God by some sort of parallel. He is spoken of as
 sitting, on account of His unchangeableness and dominion; and as
 standing, on account of His power of overcoming whatever withstands
 Him.
"," We draw near to God by no corporeal steps, since
 He is everywhere, but by the affections of our soul, and by the
 actions of that same soul do we withdraw from Him; thus, to draw near
 to or to withdraw signifies merely spiritual actions based on the
 metaphor of local motion.
",,,,,,,,,,,
14,"[I, Q. 3, Art. 2]
","Whether God Is Composed of Matter and Form?
"," It seems that God is composed of matter and form. For
 whatever has a soul is composed of matter and form; since the soul is
 the form of the body. But Scripture attributes a soul to God; for it
 is mentioned in Hebrews (Heb. 10:38), where God says: ""But My just man
 liveth by faith; but if he withdraw himself, he shall not please My
 soul."" Therefore God is composed of matter and form.
"," Further, anger, joy and the like are passions of the
 composite. But these are attributed to God in Scripture: ""The Lord was
 exceeding angry with His people"" (Ps. 105:40). Therefore God is
 composed of matter and form.
"," Further, matter is the principle of individualization.
 But God seems to be individual, for He cannot be predicated of many.
 Therefore He is composed of matter and form.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," A soul is attributed to God because His acts
 resemble the acts of a soul; for, that we will anything, is due to our
 soul. Hence what is pleasing to His will is said to be pleasing to His
 soul.
"," Anger and the like are attributed to God on
 account of a similitude of effect. Thus, because to punish is properly
 the act of an angry man, God's punishment is metaphorically spoken of
 as His anger.
"," Forms which can be received in matter are
 individualized by matter, which cannot be in another as in a subject
 since it is the first underlying subject; although form of itself,
 unless something else prevents it, can be received by many. But that
 form which cannot be received in matter, but is self-subsisting, is
 individualized precisely because it cannot be received in a subject;
 and such a form is God. Hence it does not follow that matter exists in
 God.

15,"[I, Q. 3, Art. 3]
","Whether God is the Same as His Essence or Nature?
"," It seems that God is not the same as His essence or
 nature. For nothing can be in itself. But the substance or nature of
 God--i.e. the Godhead--is said to be in God. Therefore it seems that
 God is not the same as His essence or nature.
"," Further, the effect is assimilated to its cause; for
 every agent produces its like. But in created things the suppositum
 is not identical with its nature; for a man is not the same as his
 humanity. Therefore God is not the same as His Godhead.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,," We can speak of simple things only as though
 they were like the composite things from which we derive our
 knowledge. Therefore in speaking of God, we use concrete nouns to
 signify His subsistence, because with us only those things subsist
 which are composite; and we use abstract nouns to signify His
 simplicity. In saying therefore that Godhead, or life, or the like are
 in God, we indicate the composite way in which our intellect
 understands, but not that there is any composition in God.
"," The effects of God do not imitate Him perfectly,
 but only as far as they are able; and the imitation is here defective,
 precisely because what is simple and one, can only be represented by
 divers things; consequently, composition is accidental to them, and
 therefore, in them suppositum is not the same as nature.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,"[I, Q. 3, Art. 4]
","Whether Essence and Existence Are the Same in God?
"," It seems that essence and existence are not the same in
 God. For if it be so, then the divine being has nothing added to it.
 Now being to which no addition is made is universal being which is
 predicated of all things. Therefore it follows that God is being in
 general which can be predicated of everything. But this is false: ""For
 men gave the incommunicable name to stones and wood"" (Wis. 14:21).
 Therefore God's existence is not His essence.
"," Further, we can know whether God exists as said above
 (Q. 2, A. 2); but we cannot know what He is. Therefore God's
 existence is not the same as His essence--that is, as His quiddity or
 nature.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,," A thing that has nothing added to it can be of
 two kinds. Either its essence precludes any addition; thus, for
 example, it is of the essence of an irrational animal to be without
 reason. Or we may understand a thing to have nothing added to it,
 inasmuch as its essence does not require that anything should be added
 to it; thus the genus animal is without reason, because it is not of
 the essence of animal in general to have reason; but neither is it to
 lack reason. And so the divine being has nothing added to it in the
 first sense; whereas universal being has nothing added to it in the
 second sense.
"," ""To be"" can mean either of two things. It may
 mean the act of essence, or it may mean the composition of a
 proposition effected by the mind in joining a predicate to a subject.
 Taking ""to be"" in the first sense, we cannot understand God's
 existence nor His essence; but only in the second sense. We know that
 this proposition which we form about God when we say ""God is,"" is
 true; and this we know from His effects (Q. 2, A. 2).
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,"[I, Q. 3, Art. 5]
","Whether God Is Contained in a Genus?
"," It seems that God is contained in a genus. For a
 substance is a being that subsists of itself. But this is especially
 true of God. Therefore God is in a genus of substance.
"," Further, nothing can be measured save by something of its
 own genus; as length is measured by length and numbers by number. But
 God is the measure of all substances, as the Commentator shows
 (Metaph. x). Therefore God is in the genus of substance.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The word substance signifies not only what
 exists of itself--for existence cannot of itself be a genus, as shown
 in the body of the article; but, it also signifies an essence that has
 the property of existing in this way--namely, of existing of itself;
 this existence, however, is not its essence. Thus it is clear that God
 is not in the genus of substance.
"," This objection turns upon proportionate measure
 which must be homogeneous with what is measured. Now, God is not a
 measure proportionate to anything. Still, He is called the measure of
 all things, in the sense that everything has being only according as
 it resembles Him.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,"[I, Q. 3, Art. 6]
","Whether in God There Are Any Accidents?
"," It seems that there are accidents in God. For substance
 cannot be an accident, as Aristotle says (Phys. i). Therefore that
 which is an accident in one, cannot, in another, be a substance. Thus
 it is proved that heat cannot be the substantial form of fire, because
 it is an accident in other things. But wisdom, virtue, and the like,
 which are accidents in us, are attributes of God. Therefore in God
 there are accidents.
"," Further, in every genus there is a first principle. But
 there are many genera of accidents. If, therefore, the primal
 members of these genera are not in God, there will be many primal
 beings other than God--which is absurd.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Virtue and wisdom are not predicated of God and
 of us univocally. Hence it does not follow that there are accidents in
 God as there are in us.
"," Since substance is prior to its accidents, the
 principles of accidents are reducible to the principles of the
 substance as to that which is prior; although God is not first as if
 contained in the genus of substance; yet He is first in respect to all
 being, outside of every genus.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19,"[I, Q. 3, Art. 7]
","Whether God Is Altogether Simple?
"," It seems that God is not altogether simple. For whatever
 is from God must imitate Him. Thus from the first being are all
 beings; and from the first good is all good. But in the things which
 God has made, nothing is altogether simple. Therefore neither is God
 altogether simple.
"," Further, whatever is best must be attributed to God. But
 with us that which is composite is better than that which is simple;
 thus, chemical compounds are better than simple elements, and animals
 than the parts that compose them. Therefore it cannot be said that God
 is altogether simple.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Whatever is from God imitates Him, as caused
 things imitate the first cause. But it is of the essence of a thing to
 be in some sort composite; because at least its existence differs from
 its essence, as will be shown hereafter, (Q. 4, A. 3).
"," With us composite things are better than simple
 things, because the perfections of created goodness cannot be found in
 one simple thing, but in many things. But the perfection of divine
 goodness is found in one simple thing (QQ. 4, A. 1, and 6, A. 2).
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20,"[I, Q. 3, Art. 8]
","Whether God Enters into the Composition of Other Things?
"," It seems that God enters into the composition of other
 things, for Dionysius says (Coel. Hier. iv): ""The being of all things
 is that which is above being--the Godhead."" But the being of all
 things enters into the composition of everything. Therefore God enters
 into the composition of other things.
"," Further, God is a form; for Augustine says (De Verb.
 Dom. [Serm. xxxviii]) that, ""the word of God, which is God, is an
 uncreated form."" But a form is part of a compound. Therefore God is
 part of some compound.
"," Further, whatever things exist, in no way differing from
 each other, are the same. But God and primary matter exist, and in no
 way differ from each other. Therefore they are absolutely the same.
 But primary matter enters into the composition things. Therefore also
 does God. Proof of the minor--whatever things differ, they differ by
 some differences, and therefore must be composite. But God and primary
 matter are altogether simple. Therefore they nowise differ from each
 other.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The Godhead is called the being of all things,
 as their efficient and exemplar cause, but not as being their essence.
"," The Word is an exemplar form; but not a form
 that is part of a compound.
"," Simple things do not differ by added
 differences--for this is the property of compounds. Thus man and
 horse differ by their differences, rational and irrational; which
 differences, however, do not differ from each other by other
 differences. Hence, to be quite accurate, it is better to say that
 they are, not different, but diverse. Hence, according to the
 Philosopher (Metaph. x), ""things which are diverse are absolutely
 distinct, but things which are different differ by something.""
 Therefore, strictly speaking, primary matter and God do not differ,
 but are by their very being, diverse. Hence it does not follow they
 are the same.

21,"[I, Q. 4, Art. 1]
","Whether God is Perfect?
"," It seems that perfection does not belong to God. For we
 say a thing is perfect if it is completely made. But it does not befit
 God to be made. Therefore He is not perfect.
"," Further, God is the first beginning of things. But the
 beginnings of things seem to be imperfect, as seed is the beginning of
 animal and vegetable life. Therefore God is imperfect.
"," Further, as shown above (Q. 3, A. 4), God's essence
 is existence. But existence seems most imperfect, since it is most
 universal and receptive of all modification. Therefore God is
 imperfect.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," As Gregory says (Moral. v, 26,29): ""Though our
 lips can only stammer, we yet chant the high things of God."" For that
 which is not made is improperly called perfect. Nevertheless because
 created things are then called perfect, when from potentiality they
 are brought into actuality, this word ""perfect"" signifies whatever is
 not wanting in actuality, whether this be by way of perfection or not.
"," The material principle which with us is found to
 be imperfect, cannot be absolutely primal; but must be preceded by
 something perfect. For seed, though it be the principle of animal life
 reproduced through seed, has previous to it, the animal or plant from
 which is came. Because, previous to that which is potential, must be
 that which is actual; since a potential being can only be reduced into
 act by some being already actual.
"," Existence is the most perfect of all things, for
 it is compared to all things as that by which they are made actual;
 for nothing has actuality except so far as it exists. Hence existence
 is that which actuates all things, even their forms. Therefore it is
 not compared to other things as the receiver is to the received; but
 rather as the received to the receiver. When therefore I speak of the
 existence of man, or horse, or anything else, existence is considered
 a formal principle, and as something received; and not as that which
 exists.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
22,"[I, Q. 4, Art. 2]
","Whether the Perfections of All Things Are in God?
"," It seems that the perfections of all things are not in
 God. For God is simple, as shown above (Q. 3, A. 7); whereas the
 perfections of things are many and diverse. Therefore the perfections
 of all things are not in God.
"," Further, opposites cannot coexist. Now the perfections of
 things are opposed to each other, for each thing is perfected by its
 specific difference. But the differences by which genera are
 divided, and species constituted, are opposed to each other.
 Therefore because opposites cannot coexist in the same subject, it
 seems that the perfections of all things are not in God.
"," Further, a living thing is more perfect than what merely
 exists; and an intelligent thing than what merely lives. Therefore
 life is more perfect than existence; and knowledge than life. But the
 essence of God is existence itself. Therefore He has not the
 perfections of life, and knowledge, and other similar perfections.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Even as the sun (as Dionysius remarks, (Div.
 Nom. v)), while remaining one and shining uniformly, contains within
 itself first and uniformly the substances of sensible things, and many
 and diverse qualities; a fortiori should all things in a kind of
 natural unity pre-exist in the cause of all things; and thus things
 diverse and in themselves opposed to each other, pre-exist in God as
 one, without injury to His simplicity. This suffices for the Reply to
 the Second Objection.
"," The same Dionysius says (Div. Nom. v) that,
 although existence is more perfect than life, and life than wisdom, if
 they are considered as distinguished in idea; nevertheless, a living
 thing is more perfect than what merely exists, because living things
 also exist and intelligent things both exist and live. Although
 therefore existence does not include life and wisdom, because that
 which participates in existence need not participate in every mode of
 existence; nevertheless God's existence includes in itself life and
 wisdom, because nothing of the perfection of being can be wanting to
 Him who is subsisting being itself.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
23,"[I, Q. 4, Art. 3]
","Whether Any Creature Can Be Like God?
"," It seems that no creature can be like God. For it is
 written (Ps. 85:8): ""There is none among the gods like unto Thee, O
 Lord."" But of all creatures the most excellent are those which are
 called by participation gods. Therefore still less can other creatures be
 said to be like God.
"," Further, likeness implies comparison. But there can be no
 comparison between things in a different genus. Therefore neither
 can there be any likeness. Thus we do not say that sweetness is like
 whiteness. But no creature is in the same genus as God: since God is
 no genus, as shown above (Q. 3, A. 5). Therefore no creature is
 like God.
"," Further, we speak of those things as like which agree in
 form. But nothing can agree with God in form; for, save in God alone,
 essence and existence differ. Therefore no creature can be like to
 God.
"," Further, among like things there is mutual likeness; for
 like is like to like. If therefore any creature is like God, God will
 be like some creature, which is against what is said by Isaias: ""To
 whom have you likened God?"" (Isa. 40:18).
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," As Dionysius says (Div. Nom. ix), when Holy Writ
 declares that nothing is like God, it does not mean to deny all
 likeness to Him. For, ""the same things can be like and unlike to God:
 like, according as they imitate Him, as far as He, Who is not
 perfectly imitable, can be imitated; unlike according as they fall
 short of their cause,"" not merely in intensity and remission, as that
 which is less white falls short of that which is more white; but
 because they are not in agreement, specifically or generically.
"," God is not related to creatures as though
 belonging to a different genus, but as transcending every genus,
 and as the principle of all genera.
"," Likeness of creatures to God is not affirmed on
 account of agreement in form according to the formality of the same
 genus or species, but solely according to analogy, inasmuch as God is
 essential being, whereas other things are beings by participation.
"," Although it may be admitted that creatures are
 in some sort like God, it must nowise be admitted that God is like
 creatures; because, as Dionysius says (Div. Nom. ix): ""A mutual
 likeness may be found between things of the same order, but not
 between a cause and that which is caused."" For, we say that a statue
 is like a man, but not conversely; so also a creature can be spoken of
 as in some sort like God; but not that God is like a creature.
",,,,,,,,,,,,
24,"[I, Q. 5, Art. 1]
","Whether Goodness Differs Really from Being?
"," It seems that goodness differs really from being. For
 Boethius says (De Hebdom.): ""I perceive that in nature the fact that
 things are good is one thing: that they are is another."" Therefore
 goodness and being really differ.
"," Further, nothing can be its own form. ""But that is called
 good which has the form of being,"" according to the commentary on De
 Causis. Therefore goodness differs really from being.
"," Further, goodness can be more or less. But being cannot
 be more or less. Therefore goodness differs really from being.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Although goodness and being are the same really,
 nevertheless since they differ in thought, they are not predicated of
 a thing absolutely in the same way. Since being properly signifies
 that something actually is, and actuality properly correlates to
 potentiality; a thing is, in consequence, said simply to have being,
 accordingly as it is primarily distinguished from that which is only
 in potentiality; and this is precisely each thing's substantial being.
 Hence by its substantial being, everything is said to have being
 simply; but by any further actuality it is said to have being
 relatively. Thus to be white implies relative being, for to be white
 does not take a thing out of simply potential being; because only a
 thing that actually has being can receive this mode of being. But
 goodness signifies perfection which is desirable; and consequently of
 ultimate perfection. Hence that which has ultimate perfection is said
 to be simply good; but that which has not the ultimate perfection it
 ought to have (although, in so far as it is at all actual, it has some
 perfection), is not said to be perfect simply nor good simply, but
 only relatively. In this way, therefore, viewed in its primal (i.e.
 substantial) being a thing is said to be simply, and to be good
 relatively (i.e. in so far as it has being) but viewed in its complete
 actuality, a thing is said to be relatively, and to be good simply.
 Hence the saying of Boethius (De Hebdom.), ""I perceive that in nature
 the fact that things are good is one thing; that they are is another,""
 is to be referred to a thing's goodness simply, and having being
 simply. Because, regarded in its primal actuality, a thing simply
 exists; and regarded in its complete actuality, it is good simply--in
 such sort that even in its primal actuality, it is in some sort good,
 and even in its complete actuality, it in some sort has being.
"," Goodness is a form so far as absolute goodness
 signifies complete actuality.
"," Again, goodness is spoken of as more or less
 according to a thing's superadded actuality, for example, as to
 knowledge or virtue.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
25,"[I, Q. 5, Art. 2]
","Whether Goodness Is Prior in Idea to Being?
"," It seems that goodness is prior in idea to being. For
 names are arranged according to the arrangement of the things
 signified by the names. But Dionysius (Div. Nom. iii) assigned the
 first place, amongst the other names of God, to His goodness rather
 than to His being. Therefore in idea goodness is prior to being.
"," Further, that which is the more extensive is prior in
 idea. But goodness is more extensive than being, because, as Dionysius
 notes (Div. Nom. v), ""goodness extends to things both existing and
 non-existing; whereas existence extends to existing things alone.""
 Therefore goodness is in idea prior to being.
"," Further, what is the more universal is prior in idea. But
 goodness seems to be more universal than being, since goodness has the
 aspect of desirable; whereas to some non-existence is desirable; for
 it is said of Judas: ""It were better for him, if that man had not been
 born"" (Matt. 26:24). Therefore in idea goodness is prior to being.
"," Further, not only is existence desirable, but life,
 knowledge, and many other things besides. Thus it seems that existence
 is a particular appetible, and goodness a universal appetible.
 Therefore, absolutely, goodness is prior in idea to being.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," Dionysius discusses the Divine Names (Div. Nom.
 i, iii) as implying some causal relation in God; for we name God, as
 he says, from creatures, as a cause from its effects. But goodness,
 since it has the aspect of desirable, implies the idea of a final
 cause, the causality of which is first among causes, since an agent
 does not act except for some end; and by an agent matter is moved to
 its form. Hence the end is called the cause of causes. Thus goodness,
 as a cause, is prior to being, as is the end to the form. Therefore
 among the names signifying the divine causality, goodness precedes
 being. Again, according to the Platonists, who, through not
 distinguishing primary matter from privation, said that matter was
 non-being, goodness is more extensively participated than being; for
 primary matter participates in goodness as tending to it, for all seek
 their like; but it does not participate in being, since it is presumed
 to be non-being. Therefore Dionysius says that ""goodness extends to
 non-existence"" (Div. Nom. v).
"," The same solution is applied to this objection.
 Or it may be said that goodness extends to existing and non-existing
 things, not so far as it can be predicated of them, but so far as it
 can cause them--if, indeed, by non-existence we understand not simply
 those things which do not exist, but those which are potential, and
 not actual. For goodness has the aspect of the end, in which not only
 actual things find their completion, but also towards which tend even
 those things which are not actual, but merely potential. Now being
 implies the habitude of a formal cause only, either inherent or
 exemplar; and its causality does not extend save to those things which
 are actual.
"," Non-being is desirable, not of itself, but only
 relatively--i.e. inasmuch as the removal of an evil, which can only
 be removed by non-being, is desirable. Now the removal of an evil
 cannot be desirable, except so far as this evil deprives a thing of
 some being. Therefore being is desirable of itself; and non-being only
 relatively, inasmuch as one seeks some mode of being of which one
 cannot bear to be deprived; thus even non-being can be spoken of as
 relatively good.
"," Life, wisdom, and the like, are desirable only
 so far as they are actual. Hence, in each one of them some sort of
 being is desired. And thus nothing can be desired except being; and
 consequently nothing is good except being.
",,,,,,,,,,,,
26,"[I, Q. 5, Art. 3]
","Whether Every Being Is Good?
"," It seems that not every being is good. For goodness is
 something superadded to being, as is clear from A. 1. But whatever is
 added to being limits it; as substance, quantity, quality, etc.
 Therefore goodness limits being. Therefore not every being is good.
"," Further, no evil is good: ""Woe to you that call evil good
 and good evil"" (Isa. 5:20). But some things are called evil. Therefore
 not every being is good.
"," Further, goodness implies desirability. Now primary
 matter does not imply desirability, but rather that which desires.
 Therefore primary matter does not contain the formality of goodness.
 Therefore not every being is good.
"," Further, the Philosopher notes (Metaph. iii) that ""in
 mathematics goodness does not exist."" But mathematics are entities;
 otherwise there would be no science of mathematics. Therefore not
 every being is good.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," Substance, quantity, quality, and everything
 included in them, limit being by applying it to some essence or
 nature. Now in this sense, goodness does not add anything to being
 beyond the aspect of desirability and perfection, which is also proper
 to being, whatever kind of nature it may be. Hence goodness does not
 limit being.
"," No being can be spoken of as evil, formally as
 being, but only so far as it lacks being. Thus a man is said to be
 evil, because he lacks some virtue; and an eye is said to be evil,
 because it lacks the power to see well.
"," As primary matter has only potential being, so
 it is only potentially good. Although, according to the Platonists,
 primary matter may be said to be a non-being on account of the
 privation attaching to it, nevertheless, it does participate to a
 certain extent in goodness, viz. by its relation to, or aptitude for,
 goodness. Consequently, to be desirable is not its property, but to
 desire.
"," Mathematical entities do not subsist as
 realities; because they would be in some sort good if they subsisted;
 but they have only logical existence, inasmuch as they are abstracted
 from motion and matter; thus they cannot have the aspect of an end,
 which itself has the aspect of moving another. Nor is it repugnant
 that there should be in some logical entity neither goodness nor form
 of goodness; since the idea of being is prior to the idea of goodness,
 as was said in the preceding article.
",,,,,,,,,,,,
27,"[I, Q. 5, Art. 4]
","Whether Goodness Has the Aspect of a Final Cause?
"," It seems that goodness has not the aspect of a final
 cause, but rather of the other causes. For, as Dionysius says (Div.
 Nom. iv), ""Goodness is praised as beauty."" But beauty has the aspect
 of a formal cause. Therefore goodness has the aspect of a formal
 cause.
"," Further, goodness is self-diffusive; for Dionysius says
 (Div. Nom. iv) that goodness is that whereby all things subsist, and
 are. But to be self-giving implies the aspect of an efficient cause.
 Therefore goodness has the aspect of an efficient cause.
"," Further, Augustine says (De Doctr. Christ. i, 31) that
 ""we exist because God is good."" But we owe our existence to God as the
 efficient cause. Therefore goodness implies the aspect of an efficient
 cause.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Beauty and goodness in a thing are identical
 fundamentally; for they are based upon the same thing, namely, the
 form; and consequently goodness is praised as beauty. But they differ
 logically, for goodness properly relates to the appetite (goodness
 being what all things desire); and therefore it has the aspect of an
 end (the appetite being a kind of movement towards a thing). On the
 other hand, beauty relates to the cognitive faculty; for beautiful
 things are those which please when seen. Hence beauty consists in due
 proportion; for the senses delight in things duly proportioned, as in
 what is after their own kind--because even sense is a sort of reason,
 just as is every cognitive faculty. Now since knowledge is by
 assimilation, and similarity relates to form, beauty properly belongs
 to the nature of a formal cause.
"," Goodness is described as self-diffusive in the
 sense that an end is said to move.
"," He who has a will is said to be good, so far as
 he has a good will; because it is by our will that we employ whatever
 powers we may have. Hence a man is said to be good, not by his good
 understanding; but by his good will. Now the will relates to the end
 as to its proper object. Thus the saying, ""we exist because God is
 good"" has reference to the final cause.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
28,"[I, Q. 5, Art. 5]
","Whether the Essence of Goodness Consists in Mode, Species and Order?
"," It seems that the essence of goodness does not consist in
 mode, species and order. For goodness and being differ logically. But
 mode, species and order seem to belong to the nature of being, for it
 is written: ""Thou hast ordered all things in measure, and number, and
 weight"" (Wis. 11:21). And to these three can be reduced species, mode
 and order, as Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. iv, 3): ""Measure fixes the
 mode of everything, number gives it its species, and weight gives it
 rest and stability."" Therefore the essence of goodness does not
 consist in mode, species and order.
"," Further, mode, species and order are themselves good.
 Therefore if the essence of goodness consists in mode, species and
 order, then every mode must have its own mode, species and order. The
 same would be the case with species and order in endless succession.
"," Further, evil is the privation of mode, species and
 order. But evil is not the total absence of goodness. Therefore the
 essence of goodness does not consist in mode, species and order.
"," Further, that wherein consists the essence of goodness
 cannot be spoken of as evil. Yet we can speak of an evil mode, species
 and order. Therefore the essence of goodness does not consist in mode,
 species and order.
"," Further, mode, species and order are caused by weight,
 number and measure, as appears from the quotation from Augustine. But
 not every good thing has weight, number and measure; for Ambrose says
 (Hexam. i, 9): ""It is of the nature of light not to have been created
 in number, weight and measure."" Therefore the essence of goodness does
 not consist in mode, species and order.
",,,,,,,,,,,,," These three only follow upon being, so far as it
 is perfect, and according to this perfection is it good.
"," Mode, species and order are said to be good, and
 to be beings, not as though they themselves were subsistences, but
 because it is through them that other things are both beings and good.
 Hence they have no need of other things whereby they are good: for
 they are spoken of as good, not as though formally constituted so by
 something else, but as formally constituting others good: thus
 whiteness is not said to be a being as though it were by anything
 else; but because, by it, something else has accidental being, as an
 object that is white.
"," Every being is due to some form. Hence,
 according to every being of a thing is its mode, species, order. Thus,
 a man has a mode, species and order as he is white, virtuous, learned
 and so on; according to everything predicated of him. But evil
 deprives a thing of some sort of being, as blindness deprives us of
 that being which is sight; yet it does not destroy every mode, species
 and order, but only such as follow upon the being of sight.
"," Augustine says (De Nat. Boni. xxiii), ""Every
 mode, as mode, is good"" (and the same can be said of species and
 order). ""But an evil mode, species and order are so called as being
 less than they ought to be, or as not belonging to that which they
 ought to belong. Therefore they are called evil, because they are out
 of place and incongruous.""
"," The nature of light is spoken of as being
 without number, weight and measure, not absolutely, but in comparison
 with corporeal things, because the power of light extends to all
 corporeal things; inasmuch as it is an active quality of the first
 body that causes change, i.e. the heavens.

","Whether Goodness Is Rightly Divided into the Virtuous*, the Useful
"," It seems that goodness is not rightly divided into the
 virtuous, the useful and the pleasant. For goodness is divided by the
 ten predicaments, as the Philosopher says (Ethic. i). But the
 virtuous, the useful and the pleasant can be found under one
 predicament. Therefore goodness is not rightly divided by them.
"," Further, every division is made by opposites. But these
 three do not seem to be opposites; for the virtuous is pleasing, and
 no wickedness is useful; whereas this ought to be the case if the
 division were made by opposites, for then the virtuous and the useful
 would be opposed; and Tully speaks of this (De Offic. ii). Therefore
 this division is incorrect.
"," Further, where one thing is on account of another, there
 is only one thing. But the useful is not goodness, except so far as it
 is pleasing and virtuous. Therefore the useful ought not to divided
 against the pleasant and the virtuous.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Goodness, so far as it is identical with being,
 is divided by the ten predicaments. But this division belongs to it
 according to its proper formality.
"," This division is not by opposite things; but by
 opposite aspects. Now those things are called pleasing which have no
 other formality under which they are desirable except the pleasant,
 being sometimes hurtful and contrary to virtue. Whereas the useful
 applies to such as have nothing desirable in themselves, but are
 desired only as helpful to something further, as the taking of bitter
 medicine; while the virtuous is predicated of such as are desirable in
 themselves.
"," Goodness is not divided into these three as
 something univocal to be predicated equally of them all; but as
 something analogical to be predicated of them according to priority
 and posteriority. Hence it is predicated chiefly of the virtuous; then
 of the pleasant; and lastly of the useful.

","Whether God is good?
"," It seems that to be good does not belong to God. For
 goodness consists in mode, species and order. But these do not seem to
 belong to God; since God is immense and is not ordered to anything
 else. Therefore to be good does not belong to God.
"," Further, the good is what all things desire. But all
 things do not desire God, because all things do not know Him; and
 nothing is desired unless it is known. Therefore to be good does not
 belong to God.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,," To have mode, species and order belongs to the
 essence of caused good; but good is in God as in its cause, and hence
 it belongs to Him to impose mode, species and order on others;
 wherefore these three things are in God as in their cause.
"," All things, by desiring their own perfection,
 desire God Himself, inasmuch as the perfections of all things are so
 many similitudes of the divine being; as appears from what is said
 above (Q. 4, A. 3). And so of those things which desire God, some
 know Him as He is Himself, and this is proper to the rational
 creature; others know some participation of His goodness, and this
 belongs also to sensible knowledge; others have a natural desire
 without knowledge, as being directed to their ends by a higher
 intelligence.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
31,"[I, Q. 6, Art. 2]
","Whether God Is the Supreme Good?
"," It seems that God is not the supreme good. For the
 supreme good adds something to good; otherwise it would belong to
 every good. But everything which is an addition to anything else is a
 compound thing: therefore the supreme good is a compound. But God is
 supremely simple; as was shown above (Q. 3, A. 7). Therefore God
 is not the supreme good.
"," Further, ""Good is what all desire,"" as the Philosopher
 says (Ethic. i, 1). Now what all desire is nothing but God, Who is the
 end of all things: therefore there is no other good but God. This
 appears also from what is said (Luke 18:19): ""None is good but God
 alone."" But we use the word supreme in comparison with others, as e.g.
 supreme heat is used in comparison with all other heats. Therefore God
 cannot be called the supreme good.
"," Further, supreme implies comparison. But things not in
 the same genus are not comparable; as, sweetness is not properly
 greater or less than a line. Therefore, since God is not in the same
 genus as other good things, as appears above (QQ. 3, A. 5;
 4, A. 3) it seems that God cannot be called the supreme good in
 relation to others.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The supreme good does not add to good any
 absolute thing, but only a relation. Now a relation of God to
 creatures, is not a reality in God, but in the creature; for it is in
 God in our idea only: as, what is knowable is so called with relation
 to knowledge, not that it depends on knowledge, but because knowledge
 depends on it. Thus it is not necessary that there should be
 composition in the supreme good, but only that other things are
 deficient in comparison with it.
"," When we say that good is what all desire, it is
 not to be understood that every kind of good thing is desired by all;
 but that whatever is desired has the nature of good. And when it is
 said, ""None is good but God alone,"" this is to be understood of
 essential goodness, as will be explained in the next article.
"," Things not of the same genus are in no way
 comparable to each other if indeed they are in different genera. Now
 we say that God is not in the same genus with other good things; not
 that He is any other genus, but that He is outside genus, and is the
 principle of every genus; and thus He is compared to others by excess,
 and it is this kind of comparison the supreme good implies.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
32,"[I. Q. 6, Art. 3]
","Whether to Be Essentially Good Belongs to God Alone?
"," It seems that to be essentially good does not belong to
 God alone. For as one is convertible with being, so is good; as
 we said above (Q. 5, A. 1). But every being is one essentially, as
 appears from the Philosopher (Metaph. iv); therefore every being is
 good essentially.
"," Further, if good is what all things desire, since being
 itself is desired by all, then the being of each thing is its good.
 But everything is a being essentially; therefore every being is good
 essentially.
"," Further, everything is good by its own goodness.
 Therefore if there is anything which is not good essentially, it is
 necessary to say that its goodness is not its own essence. Therefore
 its goodness, since it is a being, must be good; and if it is good by
 some other goodness, the same question applies to that goodness also;
 therefore we must either proceed to infinity, or come to some goodness
 which is not good by any other goodness. Therefore the first
 supposition holds good. Therefore everything is good essentially.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," ""One"" does not include the idea of perfection,
 but only of indivision, which belongs to everything according to its
 own essence. Now the essences of simple things are undivided both
 actually and potentially, but the essences of compounds are undivided
 only actually; and therefore everything must be one essentially, but
 not good essentially, as was shown above.
"," Although everything is good in that it has
 being, yet the essence of a creature is not very being; and therefore
 it does not follow that a creature is good essentially.
"," The goodness of a creature is not its very
 essence, but something superadded; it is either its existence, or some
 added perfection, or the order to its end. Still, the goodness itself
 thus added is good, just as it is being. But for this reason is it
 called being because by it something has being, not because it itself
 has being through something else: hence for this reason is it called
 good because by it something is good, and not because it itself has
 some other goodness whereby it is good.

33,"[I, Q. 6, Art. 4]
","Whether All Things Are Good by the Divine Goodness?
"," It seems that all things are good by the divine goodness.
 For Augustine says (De Trin. viii), ""This and that are good; take away
 this and that, and see good itself if thou canst; and so thou shalt
 see God, good not by any other good, but the good of every good."" But
 everything is good by its own good; therefore everything is good by
 that very good which is God.
"," Further, as Boethius says (De Hebdom.), all things are
 called good, accordingly as they are directed to God, and this is by
 reason of the divine goodness; therefore all things are good by the
 divine goodness.

34,"[I, Q. 7, Art. 1]
","Whether God Is Infinite?
"," It seems that God is not infinite. For everything
 infinite is imperfect, as the Philosopher says; because it has parts
 and matter, as is said in Phys. iii. But God is most perfect;
 therefore He is not infinite.
"," Further, according to the Philosopher (Phys. i), finite
 and infinite belong to quantity. But there is no quantity in God, for
 He is not a body, as was shown above (Q. 3, A. 1). Therefore it
 does not belong to Him to be infinite.
"," Further, what is here in such a way as not to be
 elsewhere, is finite according to place. Therefore that which is a
 thing in such a way as not to be another thing, is finite according to
 substance. But God is this, and not another; for He is not a stone or
 wood. Therefore God is not infinite in substance.
"," appears from what is shown above (Q. 4, A. 1, Obj. 3). Since
 therefore the divine being is not a being received in anything, but He
 is His own subsistent being as was shown above (Q. 3, A. 4), it is
 clear that God Himself is infinite and perfect.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," Quantity is terminated by its form, which can be
 seen in the fact that a figure which consists in quantity terminated,
 is a kind of quantitative form. Hence the infinite of quantity is the
 infinite of matter; such a kind of infinite cannot be attributed to
 God; as was said above, in this article.
"," The fact that the being of God is self-subsisting,
 not received in any other, and is thus called infinite, shows Him
 to be distinguished from all other beings, and all others to be
 apart from Him. Even so, were there such a thing as a
 self-subsisting whiteness, the very fact that it did not exist in
 anything else, would make it distinct from every other whiteness
 existing in a subject.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
35,"[I, Q. 7, Art. 2]
","Whether Anything but God Can Be Essentially Infinite?
"," It seems that something else besides God can be
 essentially infinite. For the power of anything is proportioned to its
 essence. Now if the essence of God is infinite, His power must also be
 infinite. Therefore He can produce an infinite effect, since the
 extent of a power is known by its effect.
"," Further, whatever has infinite power, has an infinite
 essence. Now the created intellect has an infinite power; for it
 apprehends the universal, which can extend itself to an infinitude of
 singular things. Therefore every created intellectual substance is
 infinite.
"," Further, primary matter is something other than God, as
 was shown above (Q. 3, A. 8). But primary matter is infinite.
 Therefore something besides God can be infinite.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," It is against the nature of a made thing for its
 essence to be its existence; because subsisting being is not a created
 being; hence it is against the nature of a made thing to be absolutely
 infinite. Therefore, as God, although He has infinite power, cannot
 make a thing to be not made (for this would imply that two
 contradictories are true at the same time), so likewise He cannot make
 anything to be absolutely infinite.
"," The fact that the power of the intellect extends
 itself in a way to infinite things, is because the intellect is a form
 not in matter, but either wholly separated from matter, as is the
 angelic substance, or at least an intellectual power, which is not the
 act of any organ, in the intellectual soul joined to a body.
"," Primary matter does not exist by itself in
 nature, since it is not actually being, but potentially only; hence it
 is something concreated rather than created. Nevertheless, primary
 matter even as a potentiality is not absolutely infinite, but
 relatively, because its potentiality extends only to natural forms.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
36,"[I, Q. 7, Art. 3]
","Whether an Actually Infinite Magnitude Can Exist?
"," It seems that there can be something actually infinite in
 magnitude. For in mathematics there is no error, since ""there is no
 lie in things abstract,"" as the Philosopher says (Phys. ii). But
 mathematics uses the infinite in magnitude; thus, the geometrician in
 his demonstrations says, ""Let this line be infinite."" Therefore it is
 not impossible for a thing to be infinite in magnitude.
"," Further, what is not against the nature of anything, can
 agree with it. Now to be infinite is not against the nature of
 magnitude; but rather both the finite and the infinite seem to be
 properties of quantity. Therefore it is not impossible for some
 magnitude to be infinite.
"," Further, magnitude is infinitely divisible, for the
 continuous is defined that which is infinitely divisible, as is clear
 from Phys. iii. But contraries are concerned about one and the same
 thing. Since therefore addition is opposed to division, and increase
 opposed to diminution, it appears that magnitude can be increased to
 infinity. Therefore it is possible for magnitude to be infinite.
"," Further, movement and time have quantity and continuity
 derived from the magnitude over which movement passes, as is said in
 Phys. iv. But it is not against the nature of time and movement to be
 infinite, since every determinate indivisible in time and circular
 movement is both a beginning and an end. Therefore neither is it
 against the nature of magnitude to be infinite.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," A geometrician does not need to assume a line
 actually infinite, but takes some actually finite line, from which he
 subtracts whatever he finds necessary; which line he calls infinite.
"," Although the infinite is not against the nature
 of magnitude in general, still it is against the nature of any species
 of it; thus, for instance, it is against the nature of a bicubical or
 tricubical magnitude, whether circular or triangular, and so on. Now
 what is not possible in any species cannot exist in the genus; hence
 there cannot be any infinite magnitude, since no species of magnitude
 is infinite.
"," The infinite in quantity, as was shown above,
 belongs to matter. Now by division of the whole we approach to matter,
 forasmuch as parts have the aspect of matter; but by addition we
 approach to the whole which has the aspect of a form. Therefore the
 infinite is not in the addition of magnitude, but only in division.
"," Movement and time are whole, not actually but
 successively; hence they have potentiality mixed with actuality. But
 magnitude is an actual whole; therefore the infinite in quantity
 refers to matter, and does not agree with the totality of magnitude;
 yet it agrees with the totality of time and movement: for it is proper
 to matter to be in potentiality.

37,"[I, Q. 7, Art. 4]
","Whether an Infinite Multitude Can Exist?
"," It seems that an actually infinite multitude is possible.
 For it is not impossible for a potentiality to be made actual. But
 number can be multiplied to infinity. Therefore it is possible for an
 infinite multitude actually to exist.
"," Further, it is possible for any individual of any species
 to be made actual. But the species of figures are infinite. Therefore
 an infinite number of actual figures is possible.
"," Further, things not opposed to each other do not obstruct
 each other. But supposing a multitude of things to exist, there can
 still be many others not opposed to them. Therefore it is not
 impossible for others also to coexist with them, and so on to
 infinitude; therefore an actual infinite number of things is possible.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Every potentiality is made actual according to
 its mode of being; for instance, a day is reduced to act successively,
 and not all at once. Likewise the infinite in multitude is reduced to
 act successively, and not all at once; because every multitude can be
 succeeded by another multitude to infinity.
"," Species of figures are infinite by infinitude of
 number. Now there are various species of figures, such as trilateral,
 quadrilateral and so on; and as an infinitely numerable multitude is
 not all at once reduced to act, so neither is the multitude of
 figures.
"," Although the supposition of some things does not
 preclude the supposition of others, still the supposition of an
 infinite number is opposed to any single species of multitude. Hence
 it is not possible for an actually infinite multitude to exist.

38,"[I, Q. 8, Art. 1]
","Whether God Is in All Things?
"," It seems that God is not in all things. For what is above
 all things is not in all things. But God is above all, according to
 the Psalm (Ps. 112:4), ""The Lord is high above all nations,"" etc.
 Therefore God is not in all things.
"," Further, what is in anything is thereby contained. Now
 God is not contained by things, but rather does He contain them.
 Therefore God is not in things but things are rather in Him. Hence
 Augustine says (Octog. Tri. Quaest. qu. 20), that ""in Him things are,
 rather than He is in any place.""
"," Further, the more powerful an agent is, the more extended
 is its action. But God is the most powerful of all agents. Therefore
 His action can extend to things which are far removed from Him; nor is
 it necessary that He should be in all things.
"," Further, the demons are beings. But God is not in the
 demons; for there is no fellowship between light and darkness (2 Cor.
 6:14). Therefore God is not in all things.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," God is above all things by the excellence of His
 nature; nevertheless, He is in all things as the cause of the being of
 all things; as was shown above in this article.
"," Although corporeal things are said to be in
 another as in that which contains them, nevertheless, spiritual things
 contain those things in which they are; as the soul contains the body.
 Hence also God is in things containing them; nevertheless, by a
 certain similitude to corporeal things, it is said that all things are
 in God; inasmuch as they are contained by Him.
"," No action of an agent, however powerful it may
 be, acts at a distance, except through a medium. But it belongs to the
 great power of God that He acts immediately in all things. Hence
 nothing is distant from Him, as if it could be without God in itself.
 But things are said to be distant from God by the unlikeness to Him in
 nature or grace; as also He is above all by the excellence of His own
 nature.
"," In the demons there is their nature which is
 from God, and also the deformity of sin which is not from Him;
 therefore, it is not to be absolutely conceded that God is in the
 demons, except with the addition, ""inasmuch as they are beings."" But
 in things not deformed in their nature, we must say absolutely that
 God is.

","Whether God Is Everywhere?
"," It seems that God is not everywhere. For to be everywhere
 means to be in every place. But to be in every place does not belong
 to God, to Whom it does not belong to be in place at all; for
 ""incorporeal things,"" as Boethius says (De Hebdom.), ""are not in a
 place."" Therefore God is not everywhere.
"," Further, the relation of time to succession is the same
 as the relation of place to permanence. But one indivisible part of
 action or movement cannot exist in different times; therefore neither
 can one indivisible part in the genus of permanent things be in every
 place. Now the divine being is not successive but permanent. Therefore
 God is not in many places; and thus He is not everywhere.
"," Further, what is wholly in any one place is not in part
 elsewhere. But if God is in any one place He is all there; for He has
 no parts. No part of Him then is elsewhere; and therefore God is not
 everywhere.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Incorporeal things are in place not by contact
 of dimensive quantity, as bodies are but by contact of power.
"," The indivisible is twofold. One is the term of
 the continuous; as a point in permanent things, and as a moment in
 succession; and this kind of the indivisible in permanent things,
 forasmuch as it has a determinate site, cannot be in many parts of
 place, or in many places; likewise the indivisible of action or
 movement, forasmuch as it has a determinate order in movement or
 action, cannot be in many parts of time. Another kind of the
 indivisible is outside of the whole genus of the continuous; and in
 this way incorporeal substances, like God, angel and soul, are called
 indivisible. Such a kind of indivisible does not belong to the
 continuous, as a part of it, but as touching it by its power; hence,
 according as its power can extend itself to one or to many, to a small
 thing, or to a great one, in this way it is in one or in many places,
 and in a small or large place.
"," A whole is so called with reference to its
 parts. Now part is twofold: viz. a part of the essence, as the form
 and the matter are called parts of the composite, while genus and
 difference are called parts of species. There is also part of quantity
 into which any quantity is divided. What therefore is whole in any
 place by totality of quantity, cannot be outside of that place,
 because the quantity of anything placed is commensurate to the
 quantity of the place; and hence there is no totality of quantity
 without totality of place. But totality of essence is not commensurate
 to the totality of place. Hence it is not necessary for that which is
 whole by totality of essence in a thing, not to be at all outside of
 it. This appears also in accidental forms which have accidental
 quantity; as an example, whiteness is whole in each part of the
 surface if we speak of its totality of essence; because according to
 the perfect idea of its species it is found to exist in every part of
 the surface. But if its totality be considered according to quantity
 which it has accidentally, then it is not whole in every part of the
 surface. On the other hand, incorporeal substances have no totality
 either of themselves or accidentally, except in reference to the
 perfect idea of their essence. Hence, as the soul is whole in every
 part of the body, so is God whole in all things and in each one.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
40,"[I, Q. 8, Art. 3]
","Whether God Is Everywhere by Essence, Presence and Power?
"," It seems that the mode of God's existence in all things
 is not properly described by way of essence, presence and power. For
 what is by essence in anything, is in it essentially. But God is not
 essentially in things; for He does not belong to the essence of
 anything. Therefore it ought not to be said that God is in things by
 essence, presence and power.
"," Further, to be present in anything means not to be absent
 from it. Now this is the meaning of God being in things by His
 essence, that He is not absent from anything. Therefore the presence
 of God in all things by essence and presence means the same thing.
 Therefore it is superfluous to say that God is present in things by
 His essence, presence and power.
"," Further, as God by His power is the principle of all
 things, so He is the same likewise by His knowledge and will. But it
 is not said that He is in things by knowledge and will. Therefore
 neither is He present by His power.
"," Further, as grace is a perfection added to the substance
 of a thing, so many other perfections are likewise added. Therefore if
 God is said to be in certain persons in a special way by grace, it
 seems that according to every perfection there ought to be a special
 mode of God's existence in things.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," God is said to be in all things by essence, not
 indeed by the essence of the things themselves, as if He were of their
 essence; but by His own essence; because His substance is present to
 all things as the cause of their being.
"," A thing can be said to be present to another,
 when in its sight, though the thing may be distant in substance, as
 was shown in this article; and therefore two modes of presence are
 necessary; viz. by essence and by presence.
"," Knowledge and will require that the thing known
 should be in the one who knows, and the thing willed in the one who
 wills. Hence by knowledge and will things are more truly in God than
 God in things. But power is the principle of acting on another; hence
 by power the agent is related and applied to an external thing; thus
 by power an agent may be said to be present to another.
"," No other perfection, except grace, added to
 substance, renders God present in anything as the object known and
 loved; therefore only grace constitutes a special mode of God's
 existence in things. There is, however, another special mode of God's
 existence in man by union, which will be treated of in its own place
 (Part III).

41,"[I, Q. 8, Art. 4]
","Whether to Be Everywhere Belongs to God Alone?
"," It seems that to be everywhere does not belong to God
 alone. For the universal, according to the Philosopher (Poster. i), is
 everywhere, and always; primary matter also, since it is in all
 bodies, is everywhere. But neither of these is God, as appears from
 what is said above (Q. 3). Therefore to be everywhere does not
 belong to God alone.
"," Further, number is in things numbered. But the whole
 universe is constituted in number, as appears from the Book of Wisdom
 (Wis. 11:21). Therefore there is some number which is in the whole
 universe, and is thus everywhere.
"," Further, the universe is a kind of ""whole perfect body""
 (Coel. et Mund. i). But the whole universe is everywhere, because
 there is no place outside it. Therefore to be everywhere does not
 belong to God alone.
"," Further, if any body were infinite, no place would exist
 outside of it, and so it would be everywhere. Therefore to be
 everywhere does not appear to belong to God alone.
"," Further, the soul, as Augustine says (De Trin. vi, 6), is
 ""whole in the whole body, and whole in every one of its parts.""
 Therefore if there was only one animal in the world, its soul would be
 everywhere; and thus to be everywhere does not belong to God alone.
"," Further, as Augustine says (Ep. 137), ""The soul feels
 where it sees, and lives where it feels, and is where it lives."" But
 the soul sees as it were everywhere: for in a succession of glances it
 comprehends the entire space of the heavens in its sight. Therefore
 the soul is everywhere.
",,,,,,,,,,,," The universal, and also primary matter are
 indeed everywhere; but not according to the same mode of existence.
"," Number, since it is an accident, does not, of
 itself, exist in place, but accidentally; neither is the whole but
 only part of it in each of the things numbered; hence it does not
 follow that it is primarily and absolutely everywhere.
"," The whole body of the universe is everywhere,
 but not primarily; forasmuch as it is not wholly in each place, but
 according to its parts; nor again is it everywhere absolutely,
 because, supposing that other places existed besides itself, it would
 not be in them.
"," If an infinite body existed, it would be
 everywhere; but according to its parts.
"," Were there one animal only, its soul would be
 everywhere primarily indeed, but only accidentally.
"," When it is said that the soul sees anywhere,
 this can be taken in two senses. In one sense the adverb ""anywhere""
 determines the act of seeing on the part of the object; and in this
 sense it is true that while it sees the heavens, it sees in the
 heavens; and in the same way it feels in the heavens; but it does not
 follow that it lives or exists in the heavens, because to live and to
 exist do not import an act passing to an exterior object. In another
 sense it can be understood according as the adverb determines the act
 of the seer, as proceeding from the seer; and thus it is true that
 where the soul feels and sees, there it is, and there it lives
 according to this mode of speaking; and thus it does not follow that
 it is everywhere.

","Whether God is altogether immutable?
"," It seems that God is not altogether immutable. For
 whatever moves itself is in some way mutable. But, as Augustine says
 (Gen. ad lit, viii, 20), ""The Creator Spirit moves Himself neither by
 time, nor by place."" Therefore God is in some way mutable.
"," Further, it is said of Wisdom, that ""it is more mobile
 than all things active [Vulg. 'mobilior']"" (Wis. 7:24). But God is
 wisdom itself; therefore God is movable.
"," Further, to approach and to recede signify movement. But
 these are said of God in Scripture, ""Draw nigh to God and He will draw
 nigh to you"" (James 4:8). Therefore God is mutable.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Augustine there speaks in a similar way to
 Plato, who said that the first mover moves Himself; calling every
 operation a movement, even as the acts of understanding, and willing,
 and loving, are called movements. Therefore because God understands
 and loves Himself, in that respect they said that God moves Himself,
 not, however, as movement and change belong to a thing existing in
 potentiality, as we now speak of change and movement.
"," Wisdom is called mobile by way of similitude,
 according as it diffuses its likeness even to the outermost of things;
 for nothing can exist which does not proceed from the divine wisdom by
 way of some kind of imitation, as from the first effective and formal
 principle; as also works of art proceed from the wisdom of the artist.
 And so in the same way, inasmuch as the similitude of the divine
 wisdom proceeds in degrees from the highest things, which participate
 more fully of its likeness, to the lowest things which participate of
 it in a lesser degree, there is said to be a kind of procession and
 movement of the divine wisdom to things; as when we say that the sun
 proceeds to the earth, inasmuch as the ray of light touches the earth.
 In this way Dionysius (Coel. Hier. i) expounds the matter, that every
 procession of the divine manifestation comes to us from the movement
 of the Father of light.
"," These things are said of God in Scripture
 metaphorically. For as the sun is said to enter a house, or to go out,
 according as its rays reach the house, so God is said to approach to
 us, or to recede from us, when we receive the influx of His goodness,
 or decline from Him.

","Whether to Be Immutable Belongs to God Alone?
"," It seems that to be immutable does not belong to God
 alone. For the Philosopher says (Metaph. ii) that ""matter is in
 everything which is moved."" But, according to some, certain created
 substances, as angels and souls, have not matter. Therefore to be
 immutable does not belong to God alone.
"," Further, everything in motion moves to some end. What
 therefore has already attained its ultimate end, is not in motion. But
 some creatures have already attained to their ultimate end; as all the
 blessed in heaven. Therefore some creatures are immovable.
"," Further, everything which is mutable is variable. But
 forms are invariable; for it is said (Sex Princip. i) that ""form is
 essence consisting of the simple and invariable."" Therefore it does
 not belong to God alone to be immutable.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," This objection proceeds from mutability as
 regards substantial or accidental being; for philosophers treated of
 such movement.
"," The good angels, besides their natural endowment
 of immutability of being, have also immutability of election by divine
 power; nevertheless there remains in them mutability as regards place.
"," Forms are called invariable, forasmuch as they
 cannot be subjects of variation; but they are subject to variation
 because by them their subject is variable. Hence it is clear that they
 vary in so far as they are; for they are not called beings as though
 they were the subject of being, but because through them something has
 being.

","Whether This Is a Good Definition of Eternity, ""The Simultaneously-

 Boethius (De Consol. v) is not a good one: ""Eternity is the
 simultaneously-whole and perfect possession of interminable life."" For
 the word ""interminable"" is a negative one. But negation only belongs
 to what is defective, and this does not belong to eternity. Therefore
 in the definition of eternity the word ""interminable"" ought not to be
 found.
"," Further, eternity signifies a certain kind of duration.
 But duration regards existence rather than life. Therefore the word
 ""life"" ought not to come into the definition of eternity; but rather
 the word ""existence.""
"," Further, a whole is what has parts. But this is alien to
 eternity which is simple. Therefore it is improperly said to be
 ""whole.""
"," Many days cannot occur together, nor can many times exist
 all at once. But in eternity, days and times are in the plural, for it
 is said, ""His going forth is from the beginning, from the days of
 eternity"" (Micah 5:2); and also it is said, ""According to the
 revelation of the mystery hidden from eternity"" (Rom. 16:25).
 Therefore eternity is not omni-simultaneous.
"," Further, the whole and the perfect are the same thing.
 Supposing, therefore, that it is ""whole,"" it is superfluously
 described as ""perfect.""
"," Further, duration does not imply ""possession."" But eternity
 is a kind of duration. Therefore eternity is not possession.
",,,,,,,,,,,," Simple things are usually defined by way of negation;
 as ""a point is that which has no parts."" Yet this is not to be taken
 as if the negation belonged to their essence, but because our
 intellect which first apprehends compound things, cannot attain to
 the knowledge of simple things except by removing the opposite.
"," What is truly eternal, is not only being, but also
 living; and life extends to operation, which is not true of being.
 Now the protraction of duration seems to belong to operation rather
 than to being; hence time is the numbering of movement.
"," Eternity is called whole, not because it has parts, but
 because it is wanting in nothing.
"," As God, although incorporeal, is named in Scripture
 metaphorically by corporeal names, so eternity though simultaneously
 whole, is called by names implying time and succession.
"," Two things are to be considered in time: time itself,
 which is successive; and the ""now"" of time, which is imperfect. Hence
 the expression ""simultaneously-whole"" is used to remove the idea of
 time, and the word ""perfect"" is used to exclude the ""now"" of time.
"," Whatever is possessed, is held firmly and quietly;
 therefore to designate the immutability and permanence of eternity,
 we use the word ""possession.""

45,"[I, Q. 10, Art. 2]
","Whether God is Eternal?
"," It seems that God is not eternal. For nothing made can be
 predicated of God; for Boethius says (De Trin. iv) that, ""The now that
 flows away makes time, the now that stands still makes eternity;"" and
 Augustine says (Octog. Tri. Quaest. qu. 28) ""that God is the author of
 eternity."" Therefore God is not eternal.
"," Further, what is before eternity, and after eternity, is
 not measured by eternity. But, as Aristotle says (De Causis), ""God is
 before eternity and He is after eternity"": for it is written that ""the
 Lord shall reign for eternity, and beyond [*Douay: 'for ever and
 ever']"" (Ex. 15:18). Therefore to be eternal does not belong to God.
"," Further, eternity is a kind of measure. But to be measured
 belongs not to God. Therefore it does not belong to Him to be eternal.
"," Further, in eternity, there is no present, past or future,
 since it is simultaneously whole; as was said in the preceding
 article. But words denoting present, past and future time are applied
 to God in Scripture. Therefore God is not eternal.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," The ""now"" that stands still, is said to make eternity
 according to our apprehension. As the apprehension of time is caused
 in us by the fact that we apprehend the flow of the ""now,"" so the
 apprehension of eternity is caused in us by our apprehending the
 ""now"" standing still. When Augustine says that ""God is the author of
 eternity,"" this is to be understood of participated eternity. For God
 communicates His eternity to some in the same way as He communicates
 His immutability.
"," From this appears the answer to the Second Objection.
 For God is said to be before eternity, according as it is shared by
 immaterial substances. Hence, also, in the same book, it is said that
 ""intelligence is equal to eternity."" In the words of Exodus, ""The
 Lord shall reign for eternity, and beyond,"" eternity stands for age,
 as another rendering has it. Thus it is said that the Lord will reign
 beyond eternity, inasmuch as He endures beyond every age, i.e. beyond
 every kind of duration. For age is nothing more than the period of
 each thing, as is said in the book De Coelo i. Or to reign beyond
 eternity can be taken to mean that if any other thing were conceived
 to exist for ever, as the movement of the heavens according to some
 philosophers, then God would still reign beyond, inasmuch as His
 reign is simultaneously whole.
"," Eternity is nothing else but God Himself. Hence God is
 not called eternal, as if He were in any way measured; but the idea
 of measurement is there taken according to the apprehension of our
 mind alone.
"," Words denoting different times are applied to God,
 because His eternity includes all times; not as if He Himself were
 altered through present, past and future.
",,,,,,,,,,,,
46,"[I, Q. 10, Art. 3]
","Whether to Be Eternal Belongs to God Alone?
"," It seems that it does not belong to God alone to be
 eternal. For it is written that ""those who instruct many to justice,""
 shall be ""as stars unto perpetual eternities [*Douay: 'for all
 eternity']"" (Dan. 12:3). Now if God alone were eternal, there could
 not be many eternities. Therefore God alone is not the only eternal.
"," Further, it is written ""Depart, ye cursed into eternal
 [Douay: 'everlasting'] fire"" (Matt. 25:41). Therefore God is not the
 only eternal.
"," Further, every necessary thing is eternal. But there are
 many necessary things; as, for instance, all principles of
 demonstration and all demonstrative propositions. Therefore God is
 not the only eternal.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," There are said to be many eternities, accordingly as
 many share in eternity, by the contemplation of God.
"," The fire of hell is called eternal, only because it
 never ends. Still, there is change in the pains of the lost,
 according to the words ""To extreme heat they will pass from snowy
 waters"" (Job 24:19). Hence in hell true eternity does not exist, but
 rather time; according to the text of the Psalm ""Their time will be
 for ever"" (Ps. 80:16).
"," Necessary means a certain mode of truth; and truth,
 according to the Philosopher (Metaph. vi), is in the mind. Therefore
 in this sense the true and necessary are eternal, because they are in
 the eternal mind, which is the divine intellect alone; hence it does
 not follow that anything beside God is eternal.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
47,"[I. Q. 10, Art. 4]
","Whether Eternity Differs from Time?
"," It seems that eternity does not differ from time. For two
 measures of duration cannot exist together, unless one is part of the
 other; for instance two days or two hours cannot be together;
 nevertheless, we may say that a day or an hour are together,
 considering hour as part of a day. But eternity and time occur
 together, each of which imports a certain measure of duration. Since
 therefore eternity is not a part of time, forasmuch as eternity
 exceeds time, and includes it, it seems that time is a part of
 eternity, and is not a different thing from eternity.
"," Further, according to the Philosopher (Phys. iv), the ""now""
 of time remains the same in the whole of time. But the nature of
 eternity seems to be that it is the same indivisible thing in the
 whole space of time. Therefore eternity is the ""now"" of time. But the
 ""now"" of time is not substantially different from time. Therefore
 eternity is not substantially different from time.
"," Further, as the measure of the first movement is the
 measure of every movement, as said in Phys. iv, it thus appears that
 the measure of the first being is that of every being. But eternity is
 the measure of the first being--that is, of the divine being.
 Therefore eternity is the measure of every being. But the being of
 things corruptible is measured by time. Time therefore is either
 eternity or is a part of eternity.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Such a reason would be a valid one if time and eternity
 were the same kind of measure; but this is seen not to be the case
 when we consider those things of which the respective measures are
 time and eternity.
"," The ""now"" of time is the same as regards its subject in
 the whole course of time, but it differs in aspect; for inasmuch as
 time corresponds to movement, its ""now"" corresponds to what is
 movable; and the thing movable has the same one subject in all time,
 but differs in aspect a being here and there; and such alteration is
 movement. Likewise the flow of the ""now"" as alternating in aspect is
 time. But eternity remains the same according to both subject and
 aspect; and hence eternity is not the same as the ""now"" of time.
"," As eternity is the proper measure of permanent being,
 so time is the proper measure of movement; and hence, according as
 any being recedes from permanence of being, and is subject to change,
 it recedes from eternity, and is subject to time. Therefore the being
 of things corruptible, because it is changeable, is not measured by
 eternity, but by time; for time measures not only things actually
 changed, but also things changeable; hence it not only measures
 movement but it also measures repose, which belongs to whatever is
 naturally movable, but is not actually in motion.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
48,"[I, Q. 10, Art. 5]
","The Difference of Aeviternity and Time
"," It seems that aeviternity is the same as time. For
 Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. viii, 20, 22, 23), that ""God moves the
 spiritual through time."" But aeviternity is said to be the measure of
 spiritual substances. Therefore time is the same as aeviternity.
"," Further, it is essential to time to have ""before"" and
 ""after""; but it is essential to eternity to be simultaneously whole,
 as was shown above in the first article. Now aeviternity is not
 eternity; for it is written (Ecclus. 1:1) that eternal ""Wisdom is
 before age."" Therefore it is not simultaneously whole but has ""before""
 and ""after""; and thus it is the same as time.
"," Further, if there is no ""before"" and ""after"" in
 aeviternity, it follows that in aeviternal things there is no
 difference between being, having been, or going to be. Since then it
 is impossible for aeviternal things not to have been, it follows that
 it is impossible for them not to be in the future; which is false,
 since God can reduce them to nothing.
"," Further, since the duration of aeviternal things is
 infinite as to subsequent duration, if aeviternity is simultaneously
 whole, it follows that some creature is actually infinite; which is
 impossible. Therefore aeviternity does not differ from time.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," Spiritual creatures as regards successive affections
 and intelligences are measured by time. Hence also Augustine says
 (Gen. ad lit. viii, 20, 22, 23) that to be moved through time, is
 to be moved by affections. But as regards their nature they are
 measured by aeviternity; whereas as regards the vision of glory, they
 have a share of eternity.
"," Aeviternity is simultaneously whole; yet it is not
 eternity, because ""before"" and ""after"" are compatible with it.
"," In the very being of an angel considered absolutely,
 there is no difference of past and future, but only as regards
 accidental change. Now to say that an angel was, or is, or will be,
 is to be taken in a different sense according to the acceptation of
 our intellect, which apprehends the angelic existence by comparison
 with different parts of time. But when we say that an angel is, or
 was, we suppose something, which being supposed, its opposite is not
 subject to the divine power. Whereas when we say he will be, we do
 not as yet suppose anything. Hence, since the existence and
 non-existence of an angel considered absolutely is subject to the
 divine power, God can make the existence of an angel not future; but
 He cannot cause him not to be while he is, or not to have been, after
 he has been.
"," The duration of aeviternity is infinite, forasmuch as
 it is not finished by time. Hence, there is no incongruity in saying
 that a creature is infinite, inasmuch as it is not ended by any other
 creature.
",,,,,,,,,,,,
49,"[I. Q. 10, Art. 6]
","Whether There Is Only One Aeviternity?
"," It seems that there is not only one aeviternity; for it
 is written in the apocryphal books of Esdras: ""Majesty and power of
 ages are with Thee, O Lord.""
"," Further, different genera have different measures. But
 some aeviternal things belong to the corporeal genus, as the heavenly
 bodies; and others are spiritual substances, as are the angels.
 Therefore there is not only one aeviternity.
"," Further, since aeviternity is a term of duration, where
 there is one aeviternity, there is also one duration. But not all
 aeviternal things have one duration, for some begin to exist after
 others; as appears in the case especially of human souls. Therefore
 there is not only one aeviternity.
"," Further, things not dependent on each other do not seem
 to have one measure of duration; for there appears to be one time for
 all temporal things; since the first movement, measured by time, is in
 some way the cause of all movement. But aeviternal things do not
 depend on each other, for one angel is not the cause of another angel.
 Therefore there is not only one aeviternity.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," Aeviternity is sometimes taken for age, that is, a
 space of a thing's duration; and thus we say many aeviternities when
 we mean ages.
"," Although the heavenly bodies and spiritual things
 differ in the genus of their nature, still they agree in having a
 changeless being, and are thus measured by aeviternity.
"," All temporal things did not begin together;
 nevertheless there is one time for all of them, by reason of the
 first measured by time; and thus all aeviternal things have one
 aeviternity by reason of the first, though all did not begin together.
"," For things to be measured by one, it is not necessary
 that the one should be the cause of all, but that it be more simple
 than the rest.
",,,,,,,,,,,,
50,"[I, Q. 11, Art. 1]
","Whether ""One"" Adds Anything to ""Being""?
"," It seems that ""one"" adds something to ""being."" For
 everything is in a determinate genus by addition to being, which
 penetrates all genera. But ""one"" is a determinate genus, for it is
 the principle of number, which is a species of quantity. Therefore
 ""one"" adds something to ""being.""
"," Further, what divides a thing common to all, is an
 addition to it. But ""being"" is divided by ""one"" and by ""many.""
 Therefore ""one"" is an addition to ""being.""
"," Further, if ""one"" is not an addition to ""being,"" ""one""
 and ""being"" must have the same meaning. But it would be nugatory to
 call ""being"" by the name of ""being""; therefore it would be equally so
 to call being ""one."" Now this is false. Therefore ""one"" is an addition
 to ""being.""
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Some, thinking that the ""one"" convertible with ""being""
 is the same as the ""one"" which is the principle of number, were
 divided into contrary opinions. Pythagoras and Plato, seeing that the
 ""one"" convertible with ""being"" did not add any reality to ""being,""
 but signified the substance of ""being"" as undivided, thought that the
 same applied to the ""one"" which is the principle of number. And
 because number is composed of unities, they thought that numbers were
 the substances of all things. Avicenna, however, on the contrary,
 considering that ""one"" which is the principle of number, added a
 reality to the substance of ""being"" (otherwise number made of unities
 would not be a species of quantity), thought that the ""one""
 convertible with ""being"" added a reality to the substance of beings;
 as ""white"" to ""man."" This, however, is manifestly false, inasmuch as
 each thing is ""one"" by its substance. For if a thing were ""one"" by
 anything else but by its substance, since this again would be ""one,""
 supposing it were again ""one"" by another thing, we should be driven
 on to infinity. Hence we must adhere to the former statement;
 therefore we must say that the ""one"" which is convertible with
 ""being,"" does not add a reality to being; but that the ""one"" which is
 the principle of number, does add a reality to ""being,"" belonging to
 the genus of quantity.
"," There is nothing to prevent a thing which in one way is
 divided, from being another way undivided; as what is divided in
 number, may be undivided in species; thus it may be that a thing is
 in one way ""one,"" and in another way ""many."" Still, if it is
 absolutely undivided, either because it is so according to what
 belongs to its essence, though it may be divided as regards what is
 outside its essence, as what is one in subject may have many
 accidents; or because it is undivided actually, and divided
 potentially, as what is ""one"" in the whole, and is ""many"" in parts;
 in such a case a thing will be ""one"" absolutely and ""many""
 accidentally. On the other hand, if it be undivided accidentally, and
 divided absolutely, as if it were divided in essence and undivided in
 idea or in principle or cause, it will be ""many"" absolutely and ""one""
 accidentally; as what are ""many"" in number and ""one"" in species or
 ""one"" in principle. Hence in that way, being is divided by ""one"" and
 by ""many""; as it were by ""one"" absolutely and by ""many"" accidentally.
 For multitude itself would not be contained under ""being,"" unless it
 were in some way contained under ""one."" Thus Dionysius says (Div.
 Nom., cap. ult.) that ""there is no kind of multitude that is not in
 a way one. But what are many in their parts, are one in their whole;
 and what are many in accidents, are one in subject; and what are many
 in number, are one in species; and what are many in species, are one
 in genus; and what are many in processions, are one in principle.""
"," It does not follow that it is nugatory to say
 ""being"" is ""one""; forasmuch as ""one"" adds an idea to ""being.""
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
51,"[I, Q. 11, Art. 2]
","Whether ""One"" and ""Many"" Are Opposed to Each Other?
"," It seems that ""one"" and ""many"" are not mutually opposed.
 For no opposite thing is predicated of its opposite. But every
 multitude is in a certain way one, as appears from the preceding
 article. Therefore ""one"" is not opposed to ""multitude.""
"," Further, no opposite thing is constituted by its
 opposite. But multitude is constituted by one. Therefore it is not
 opposed to ""multitude.""
"," Further, ""one"" is opposed to ""one."" But the idea of ""few""
 is opposed to ""many."" Therefore ""one"" is not opposed to ""many.""
"," Further, if ""one"" is opposed to ""multitude,"" it is
 opposed as the undivided is to the divided; and is thus opposed to it
 as privation is to habit. But this appears to be incongruous; because
 it would follow that ""one"" comes after ""multitude,"" and is defined by
 it; whereas, on the contrary, ""multitude"" is defined by ""one."" Hence
 there would be a vicious circle in the definition; which is
 inadmissible. Therefore ""one"" and ""many"" are not opposed.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," No privation entirely takes away the being of a thing,
 inasmuch as privation means ""negation in the subject,"" according to
 the Philosopher (Categor. viii). Nevertheless every privation takes
 away some being; and so in being, by reason of its universality, the
 privation of being has its foundation in being; which is not the case
 in privations of special forms, as of sight, or of whiteness and the
 like. And what applies to being applies also to one and to good,
 which are convertible with being, for the privation of good is
 founded in some good; likewise the removal of unity is founded in
 some one thing. Hence it happens that multitude is some one thing;
 and evil is some good thing, and non-being is some kind of being.
 Nevertheless, opposite is not predicated of opposite; forasmuch as
 one is absolute, and the other is relative; for what is relative
 being (as a potentiality) is non-being absolutely, i.e. actually; or
 what is absolute being in the genus of substance is non-being
 relatively as regards some accidental being. In the same way, what is
 relatively good is absolutely bad, or vice versa; likewise what is
 absolutely one is relatively many, and vice versa.
"," A whole is twofold. In one sense it is homogeneous,
 composed of like parts; in another sense it is heterogeneous,
 composed of dissimilar parts. Now in every homogeneous whole, the
 whole is made up of parts having the form of the whole; as, for
 instance, every part of water is water; and such is the constitution
 of a continuous thing made up of its parts. In every heterogeneous
 whole, however, every part is wanting in the form belonging to the
 whole; as, for instance, no part of a house is a house, nor is any
 part of a man a man. Now multitude is such a kind of a whole.
 Therefore inasmuch as its part has not the form of the multitude, the
 latter is composed of unities, as a house is composed of not houses;
 not, indeed, as if unities constituted multitude so far as they are
 undivided, in which way they are opposed to multitude; but so far as
 they have being, as also the parts of a house make up the house by
 the fact that they are beings, not by the fact that they are not
 houses.
"," ""Many"" is taken in two ways: absolutely, and in that
 sense it is opposed to ""one""; in another way as importing some kind
 of excess, in which sense it is opposed to ""few""; hence in the first
 sense two are many but not in the second sense.
"," ""One"" is opposed to ""many"" privatively, inasmuch as the
 idea of ""many"" involves division. Hence division must be prior to
 unity, not absolutely in itself, but according to our way of
 apprehension. For we apprehend simple things by compound things; and
 hence we define a point to be, ""what has no part,"" or ""the beginning
 of a line."" ""Multitude"" also, in idea, follows on ""one""; because we
 do not understand divided things to convey the idea of multitude
 except by the fact that we attribute unity to every part. Hence ""one""
 is placed in the definition of ""multitude""; but ""multitude"" is not
 placed in the definition of ""one."" But division comes to be
 understood from the very negation of being: so what first comes to
 mind is being; secondly, that this being is not that being, and thus
 we apprehend division as a consequence; thirdly, comes the notion of
 one; fourthly, the notion of multitude.

","Whether God Is One?
"," It seems that God is not one. For it is written ""For
 there be many gods and many lords"" (1 Cor. 8:5).
"," Further, ""One,"" as the principle of number, cannot be
 predicated of God, since quantity is not predicated of God; likewise,
 neither can ""one"" which is convertible with ""being"" be predicated of
 God, because it imports privation, and every privation is an
 imperfection, which cannot apply to God. Therefore God is not one.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Gods are called many by the error of some who
 worshipped many deities, thinking as they did that the planets and
 other stars were gods, and also the separate parts of the world.
 Hence the Apostle adds: ""Our God is one,"" etc.
"," ""One"" which is the principle of number is not
 predicated of God, but only of material things. For ""one"" the
 principle of number belongs to the genus of mathematics, which are
 material in being, and abstracted from matter only in idea. But ""one""
 which is convertible with being is a metaphysical entity and does not
 depend on matter in its being. And although in God there is no
 privation, still, according to the mode of our apprehension, He is
 known to us by way only of privation and remotion. Thus there is no
 reason why a certain kind of privation should not be predicated of
 God; for instance, that He is incorporeal and infinite; and in the
 same way it is said of God that He is one.

","Whether God Is Supremely One?
"," It seems that God is not supremely one. For ""one"" is so
 called from the privation of division. But privation cannot be greater
 or less. Therefore God is not more ""one"" than other things which are
 called ""one.""
"," Further, nothing seems to be more indivisible than what
 is actually and potentially indivisible; such as a point and unity.
 But a thing is said to be more ""one"" according as it is indivisible.
 Therefore God is not more one than unity is one and a point is
 one.
"," Further, what is essentially good is supremely good.
 Therefore what is essentially one is supremely one. But every
 being is essentially one, as the Philosopher says (Metaph. iv).
 Therefore every being is supremely one; and therefore God is not
 one more than any other being is one.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Although privation considered in itself is not
 susceptive of more or less, still according as its opposite is
 subject to more or less, privation also can be considered itself in
 the light of more and less. Therefore according as a thing is more
 divided, or is divisible, either less or not at all, in the degree it
 is called more, or less, or supremely, one.
"," A point and unity which is the principle of number, are
 not supremely being, inasmuch as they have being only in some
 subject. Hence neither of them can be supremely one. For as a
 subject cannot be supremely one, because of the difference within
 it of accident and subject, so neither can an accident.

 every such substance is not equally the cause of unity; for the
 substance of some things is compound and of others simple.

","Whether Any Created Intellect Can See the Essence of God?
"," It seems that no created intellect can see the essence of
 God. For Chrysostom (Hom. xiv. in Joan.) commenting on John 1:18, ""No
 man hath seen God at any time,"" says: ""Not prophets only, but neither
 angels nor archangels have seen God. For how can a creature see what
 is increatable?"" Dionysius also says (Div. Nom. i), speaking of God:
 ""Neither is there sense, nor image, nor opinion, nor reason, nor
 knowledge of Him.""
"," Further, everything infinite, as such, is unknown. But
 God is infinite, as was shown above (Q. 7, A. 1). Therefore in
 Himself He is unknown.
"," Further, the created intellect knows only existing things.
 For what falls first under the apprehension of the intellect is
 being. Now God is not something existing; but He is rather
 super-existence, as Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv). Therefore God is
 not intelligible; but above all intellect.
"," Further, there must be some proportion between the knower
 and the known, since the known is the perfection of the knower. But no
 proportion exists between the created intellect and God; for there is
 an infinite distance between them. Therefore the created intellect
 cannot see the essence of God.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," Both of these authorities speak of the vision of
 comprehension. Hence Dionysius premises immediately before the words
 cited, ""He is universally to all incomprehensible,"" etc. Chrysostom
 likewise after the words quoted says: ""He says this of the most
 certain vision of the Father, which is such a perfect consideration
 and comprehension as the Father has of the Son.""
"," The infinity of matter not made perfect by form, is
 unknown in itself, because all knowledge comes by the form; whereas
 the infinity of the form not limited by matter, is in itself
 supremely known. God is Infinite in this way, and not in the first
 way: as appears from what was said above (Q. 7, A. 1).
"," God is not said to be not existing as if He did not
 exist at all, but because He exists above all that exists; inasmuch
 as He is His own existence. Hence it does not follow that He cannot
 be known at all, but that He exceeds every kind of knowledge; which
 means that He is not comprehended.
"," Proportion is twofold. In one sense it means a certain
 relation of one quantity to another, according as double, treble and
 equal are species of proportion. In another sense every relation of
 one thing to another is called proportion. And in this sense there
 can be a proportion of the creature to God, inasmuch as it is related
 to Him as the effect of its cause, and as potentiality to its act;
 and in this way the created intellect can be proportioned to know God.

 Thee, but now my eye seeth Thee.""
"," Further, Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xxix, 29): ""Those

 sight, not so much to see more keenly, as some report of the sight of
 serpents or of eagles (for whatever acuteness of vision is possessed
 by these creatures, they can see only corporeal things) but to see
 even incorporeal things."" Now whoever can see incorporeal things, can
 be raised up to see God. Therefore the glorified eye can see God.
"," Further, God can be seen by man through a vision of the
 imagination. For it is written: ""I saw the Lord sitting upon a
 throne,"" etc. (Isa. 6:1). But an imaginary vision originates from
 sense; for the imagination is moved by sense to act. Therefore God can
 be seen by a vision of sense.

 Likewise the words, ""Now my eye seeth Thee,"" are to be understood of
 the mind's eye, as the Apostle says: ""May He give unto you the spirit
 of wisdom . . . in the knowledge of Him, that the eyes of your heart""
 may be ""enlightened"" (Eph. 1:17, 18).
"," Augustine speaks as one inquiring, and conditionally.
 This appears from what he says previously: ""Therefore they will have
 an altogether different power (viz. the glorified eyes), if they
 shall see that incorporeal nature;"" and afterwards he explains this,
 saying: ""It is very credible, that we shall so see the mundane bodies
 of the new heaven and the new earth, as to see most clearly God
 everywhere present, governing all corporeal things, not as we now see
 the invisible things of God as understood by what is made; but as
 when we see men among whom we live, living and exercising the
 functions of human life, we do not believe they live, but see it.""
 Hence it is evident how the glorified eyes will see God, as now our
 eyes see the life of another. But life is not seen with the corporeal
 eye, as a thing in itself visible, but as the indirect object of the
 sense; which indeed is not known by sense, but at once, together with
 sense, by some other cognitive power. But that the divine presence is
 known by the intellect immediately on the sight of, and through,
 corporeal things, happens from two causes--viz. from the perspicuity
 of the intellect, and from the refulgence of the divine glory infused
 into the body after its renovation.
"," The essence of God is not seen in a vision of the
 imagination; but the imagination receives some form representing God
 according to some mode of similitude; as in the divine Scripture
 divine things are metaphorically described by means of sensible
 things.

57,"[I, Q. 12, Art. 4]
","Whether Any Created Intellect by Its Natural Powers Can See the Divine
"," It seems that a created intellect can see the Divine
 essence by its own natural power. For Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv):
 ""An angel is a pure mirror, most clear, receiving, if it is right to
 say so, the whole beauty of God."" But if a reflection is seen, the
 original thing is seen. Therefore since an angel by his natural power
 understands himself, it seems that by his own natural power he
 understands the Divine essence.
"," Further, what is supremely visible, is made less visible to
 us by reason of our defective corporeal or intellectual sight. But
 the angelic intellect has no such defect. Therefore, since God is
 supremely intelligible in Himself, it seems that in like manner He is
 supremely so to an angel. Therefore, if he can understand other
 intelligible things by his own natural power, much more can he
 understand God.
"," Further, corporeal sense cannot be raised up to understand
 incorporeal substance, which is above its nature. Therefore if to see
 the essence of God is above the nature of every created intellect, it
 follows that no created intellect can reach up to see the essence of
 God at all. But this is false, as appears from what is said above (A.
 1). Therefore it seems that it is natural for a created intellect to
 see the Divine essence.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," This mode of knowing God is natural to an
 angel--namely, to know Him by His own likeness refulgent in the angel
 himself. But to know God by any created similitude is not to know the
 essence of God, as was shown above (A. 2). Hence it does not follow
 that an angel can know the essence of God by his own power.
"," The angelic intellect is not defective, if defect be
 taken to mean privation, as if it were without anything which it
 ought to have. But if the defect be taken negatively, in that sense
 every creature is defective, when compared with God; forasmuch as it
 does not possess the excellence which is in God.
"," The sense of sight, as being altogether material,
 cannot be raised up to immateriality. But our intellect, or the
 angelic intellect, inasmuch as it is elevated above matter in its own
 nature, can be raised up above its own nature to a higher level by
 grace. The proof is, that sight cannot in any way know abstractedly
 what it knows concretely; for in no way can it perceive a nature
 except as this one particular nature; whereas our intellect is able
 to consider abstractedly what it knows concretely. Now although it
 knows things which have a form residing in matter, still it resolves
 the composite into both of these elements; and it considers the form
 separately by itself. Likewise, also, the intellect of an angel,
 although it naturally knows the concrete in any nature, still it is
 able to separate that existence by its intellect; since it knows that
 the thing itself is one thing, and its existence is another. Since
 therefore the created intellect is naturally capable of apprehending
 the concrete form, and the concrete being abstractedly, by way of a
 kind of resolution of parts; it can by grace be raised up to know
 separate subsisting substance, and separate subsisting existence.

58,"[I, Q. 12, Art. 5]
","Whether the Created Intellect Needs Any Created Light in Order to See the
"," It seems that the created intellect does not need any
 created light in order to see the essence of God. For what is of
 itself lucid in sensible things does not require any other light in
 order to be seen. Therefore the same applies to intelligible things.
 Now God is intelligible light. Therefore He is not seen by means of
 any created light.
"," Further, if God is seen through a medium, He is not seen
 in His essence. But if seen by any created light, He is seen through a
 medium. Therefore He is not seen in His essence.
"," Further, what is created can be natural to some creature.
 Therefore if the essence of God is seen through any created light,
 such a light can be made natural to some other creature; and thus,
 that creature would not need any other light to see God; which is
 impossible. Therefore it is not necessary that every creature should
 require a superadded light in order to see the essence of God.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The created light is necessary to see the
 essence of God, not in order to make the essence of God intelligible,
 which is of itself intelligible, but in order to enable the intellect
 to understand in the same way as a habit makes a power abler to act.
 Even so corporeal light is necessary as regards external sight,
 inasmuch as it makes the medium actually transparent, and susceptible
 of color.
"," This light is required to see the divine
 essence, not as a similitude in which God is seen, but as a perfection
 of the intellect, strengthening it to see God. Therefore it may be
 said that this light is to be described not as a medium in which God
 is seen, but as one by which He is seen; and such a medium does not
 take away the immediate vision of God.
"," The disposition to the form of fire can be
 natural only to the subject of that form. Hence the light of glory
 cannot be natural to a creature unless the creature has a divine
 nature; which is impossible. But by this light the rational creature
 is made deiform, as is said in this article.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
59,"[I. Q. 12, Art. 6]
","Whether of Those Who See the Essence of God, One Sees More Perfectly Than
"," It seems that of those who see the essence of God, one
 does not see more perfectly than another. For it is written (1 John
 3:2): ""We shall see Him as He is."" But He is only in one way.
 Therefore He will be seen by all in one way only; and therefore He
 will not be seen more perfectly by one and less perfectly by another.
"," Further, Augustine says (Octog. Tri. Quaest. qu. xxxii):
 ""One person cannot see one and the same thing more perfectly than
 another."" But all who see the essence of God, understand the Divine
 essence, for God is seen by the intellect and not by sense, as was
 shown above (A. 3). Therefore of those who see the divine essence,
 one does not see more clearly than another.
"," Further, That anything be seen more perfectly than another
 can happen in two ways: either on the part of the visible object, or
 on the part of the visual power of the seer. On the part of the
 object, it may so happen because the object is received more
 perfectly in the seer, that is, according to the greater perfection
 of the similitude; but this does not apply to the present question,
 for God is present to the intellect seeing Him not by way of
 similitude, but by His essence. It follows then that if one sees Him
 more perfectly than another, this happens according to the difference
 of the intellectual power; thus it follows too that the one whose
 intellectual power is higher, will see Him the more clearly; and this
 is incongruous; since equality with angels is promised to men as
 their beatitude.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," In the words, ""We shall see Him as He is,"" the
 conjunction ""as"" determines the mode of vision on the part of the
 object seen, so that the meaning is, we shall see Him to be as He is,
 because we shall see His existence, which is His essence. But it does
 not determine the mode of vision on the part of the one seeing; as if
 the meaning was that the mode of seeing God will be as perfect as is
 the perfect mode of God's existence.
"," The diversity of seeing will not arise on the part of
 the object seen, for the same object will be presented to all--viz.
 the essence of God; nor will it arise from the diverse participation
 of the object seen by different similitudes; but it will arise on the
 part of the diverse faculty of the intellect, not, indeed, the
 natural faculty, but the glorified faculty.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
60,"[I, Q. 12, Art. 7]
","Whether Those Who See the Essence of God Comprehend Him?
"," It seems that those who see the divine essence,
 comprehend God. For the Apostle says (Phil. 3:12): ""But I follow
 after, if I may by any means comprehend [Douay: 'apprehend']."" But the
 Apostle did not follow in vain; for he said (1 Cor. 9:26): ""I . . . so
 run, not as at an uncertainty."" Therefore he comprehended; and in the
 same way, others also, whom he invites to do the same, saying: ""So run
 that you may comprehend.""
"," Further, Augustine says (De Vid. Deum, Ep. cxlvii): ""That
 is comprehended which is so seen as a whole, that nothing of it is
 hidden from the seer."" But if God is seen in His essence, He is seen
 whole, and nothing of Him is hidden from the seer, since God is
 simple. Therefore whoever sees His essence, comprehends Him.
"," Further, if we say that He is seen as a ""whole,"" but not
 ""wholly,"" it may be contrarily urged that ""wholly"" refers either to
 the mode of the seer, or to the mode of the thing seen. But he who
 sees the essence of God, sees Him wholly, if the mode of the thing
 seen is considered; forasmuch as he sees Him as He is; also, likewise,
 he sees Him wholly if the mode of the seer is meant, forasmuch as the
 intellect will with its full power see the Divine essence. Therefore
 all who see the essence of God see Him wholly; therefore they
 comprehend Him.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," ""Comprehension"" is twofold: in one sense it is taken
 strictly and properly, according as something is included in the one
 comprehending; and thus in no way is God comprehended either by
 intellect, or in any other way; forasmuch as He is infinite and
 cannot be included in any finite being; so that no finite being can
 contain Him infinitely, in the degree of His own infinity. In this
 sense we now take comprehension. But in another sense ""comprehension""
 is taken more largely as opposed to ""non-attainment""; for he who
 attains to anyone is said to comprehend him when he attains to him.
 And in this sense God is comprehended by the blessed, according to
 the words, ""I held him, and I will not let him go"" (Cant. 3:4); in
 this sense also are to be understood the words quoted from the
 Apostle concerning comprehension. And in this way ""comprehension"" is
 one of the three prerogatives of the soul, responding to hope, as
 vision responds to faith, and fruition responds to charity. For even
 among ourselves not everything seen is held or possessed, forasmuch
 as things either appear sometimes afar off, or they are not in our
 power of attainment. Neither, again, do we always enjoy what we
 possess; either because we find no pleasure in them, or because such
 things are not the ultimate end of our desire, so as to satisfy and
 quell it. But the blessed possess these three things in God; because
 they see Him, and in seeing Him, possess Him as present, having the
 power to see Him always; and possessing Him, they enjoy Him as the
 ultimate fulfilment of desire.
"," God is called incomprehensible not because anything of
 Him is not seen; but because He is not seen as perfectly as He is
 capable of being seen; thus when any demonstrable proposition is
 known by probable reason only, it does not follow that any part of it
 is unknown, either the subject, or the predicate, or the composition;
 but that it is not as perfectly known as it is capable of being
 known. Hence Augustine, in his definition of comprehension, says the
 whole is comprehended when it is seen in such a way that nothing of
 it is hidden from the seer, or when its boundaries can be completely
 viewed or traced; for the boundaries of a thing are said to be
 completely surveyed when the end of the knowledge of it is attained.
"," The word ""wholly"" denotes a mode of the object; not
 that the whole object does not come under knowledge, but that the
 mode of the object is not the mode of the one who knows. Therefore he
 who sees God's essence, sees in Him that He exists infinitely, and is
 infinitely knowable; nevertheless, this infinite mode does not extend
 to enable the knower to know infinitely; thus, for instance, a person
 can have a probable opinion that a proposition is demonstrable,
 although he himself does not know it as demonstrated.

61,"[I, Q. 12, Art. 8]
","Whether Those Who See the Essence of God See All in God?
"," It seems that those who see the essence of God see all
 things in God. For Gregory says (Dialog. iv): ""What do they not see,
 who see Him Who sees all things?"" But God sees all things. Therefore
 those who see God see all things.
"," Further, whoever sees a mirror, sees what is reflected in
 the mirror. But all actual or possible things shine forth in God as in
 a mirror; for He knows all things in Himself. Therefore whoever sees
 God, sees all actual things in Him, and also all possible things.
"," Further, whoever understands the greater, can understand
 the least, as is said in De Anima iii. But all that God does, or can
 do, are less than His essence. Therefore whoever understands God, can
 understand all that God does, or can do.
"," Further, the rational creature naturally desires to know
 all things. Therefore if in seeing God it does not know all things,
 its natural desire will not rest satisfied; thus, in seeing God it
 will not be fully happy; which is incongruous. Therefore he who sees
 God knows all things.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," Gregory speaks as regards the object being sufficient,
 namely, God, who in Himself sufficiently contains and shows forth all
 things; but it does not follow that whoever sees God knows all
 things, for he does not perfectly comprehend Him.
"," It is not necessary that whoever sees a mirror should
 see all that is in the mirror, unless his glance comprehends the
 mirror itself.
"," Although it is more to see God than to see all things
 else, still it is a greater thing to see Him so that all things are
 known in Him, than to see Him in such a way that not all things, but
 the fewer or the more, are known in Him. For it has been shown in
 this article that the more things are known in God according as He is
 seen more or less perfectly.
"," The natural desire of the rational creature is to know
 everything that belongs to the perfection of the intellect, namely,
 the species and the genera of things and their types, and these
 everyone who sees the Divine essence will see in God. But to know
 other singulars, their thoughts and their deeds does not belong to
 the perfection of the created intellect nor does its natural desire
 go out to these things; neither, again, does it desire to know things
 that exist not as yet, but which God can call into being. Yet if God
 alone were seen, Who is the fount and principle of all being and of
 all truth, He would so fill the natural desire of knowledge that
 nothing else would be desired, and the seer would be completely
 beatified. Hence Augustine says (Confess. v): ""Unhappy the man who
 knoweth all these"" (i.e. all creatures) ""and knoweth not Thee! but
 happy whoso knoweth Thee although he know not these. And whoso
 knoweth both Thee and them is not the happier for them, but for Thee
 alone.""

62,"[I, Q. 12, Art. 9]
","Whether What Is Seen in God by Those Who See the Divine Essence, Is Seen
"," It seems that what is seen in God by those who see the
 Divine essence, is seen by means of some similitude. For every kind of
 knowledge comes about by the knower being assimilated to the object
 known. For thus the intellect in act becomes the actual intelligible,
 and the sense in act becomes the actual sensible, inasmuch as it is
 informed by a similitude of the object, as the eye by the similitude
 of color. Therefore if the intellect of one who sees the Divine
 essence understands any creatures in God, it must be informed by their
 similitudes.
"," Further, what we have seen, we keep in memory. But Paul,
 seeing the essence of God whilst in ecstasy, when he had ceased to see
 the Divine essence, as Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. ii, 28,34),
 remembered many of the things he had seen in the rapture; hence he
 said: ""I have heard secret words which it is not granted to man to
 utter"" (2 Cor. 12:4). Therefore it must be said that certain
 similitudes of what he remembered, remained in his mind; and in the
 same way, when he actually saw the essence of God, he had certain
 similitudes or ideas of what he actually saw in it.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The created intellect of one who sees God is
 assimilated to what is seen in God, inasmuch as it is united to the
 Divine essence, in which the similitudes of all things pre-exist.
"," Some of the cognitive faculties form other images from
 those first conceived; thus the imagination from the preconceived
 images of a mountain and of gold can form the likeness of a golden
 mountain; and the intellect, from the preconceived ideas of genus and
 difference, forms the idea of species; in like manner from the
 similitude of an image we can form in our minds the similitude of the
 original of the image. Thus Paul, or any other person who sees God,
 by the very vision of the divine essence, can form in himself the
 similitudes of what is seen in the divine essence, which remained in
 Paul even when he had ceased to see the essence of God. Still this
 kind of vision whereby things are seen by this likeness thus
 conceived, is not the same as that whereby things are seen in God.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
63,"[I, Q. 12, Art. 10]
","Whether Those Who See the Essence of God See All They See in It at the
"," It seems that those who see the essence of God do not see
 all they see in Him at one and the same time. For according to the
 Philosopher (Topic. ii): ""It may happen that many things are known,
 but only one is understood."" But what is seen in God, is understood;
 for God is seen by the intellect. Therefore those who see God do not
 see all in Him at the same time.
"," Further, Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. viii, 22, 23), ""God
 moves the spiritual creature according to time""--i.e. by intelligence
 and affection. But the spiritual creature is the angel who sees God.
 Therefore those who see God understand and are affected successively;
 for time means succession.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,," We understand one thing only when we understand by one
 idea; but many things understood by one idea are understood
 simultaneously, as in the idea of a man we understand ""animal"" and
 ""rational""; and in the idea of a house we understand the wall and the
 roof.
"," As regards their natural knowledge, whereby they know
 things by diverse ideas given them, the angels do not know all things
 simultaneously, and thus they are moved in the act of understanding
 according to time; but as regards what they see in God, they see all
 at the same time.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
64,"[I, Q. 12, Art. 11]
","Whether Anyone in This Life Can See the Essence of God?
"," It seems that one can in this life see the Divine
 essence. For Jacob said: ""I have seen God face to face"" (Gen. 32:30).
 But to see Him face to face is to see His essence, as appears from the
 words: ""We see now in a glass and in a dark manner, but then face to
 face"" (1 Cor. 13:12).
"," Further, the Lord said to Moses: ""I speak to him mouth to
 mouth, and plainly, and not by riddles and figures doth he see the
 Lord"" (Num. 12:8); but this is to see God in His essence. Therefore it
 is possible to see the essence of God in this life.
"," Further, that wherein we know all other things, and whereby
 we judge of other things, is known in itself to us. But even now we
 know all things in God; for Augustine says (Confess. viii): ""If we
 both see that what you say is true, and we both see that what I say
 is true; where, I ask, do we see this? neither I in thee, nor thou in
 me; but both of us in the very incommutable truth itself above our
 minds."" He also says (De Vera Relig. xxx) that, ""We judge of all
 things according to the divine truth""; and (De Trin. xii) that, ""it
 is the duty of reason to judge of these corporeal things according to
 the incorporeal and eternal ideas; which unless they were above the
 mind could not be incommutable."" Therefore even in this life we see
 God Himself.
"," Further, according to Augustine (Gen. ad lit. xii, 24, 25),
 those things that are in the soul by their essence are seen by
 intellectual vision. But intellectual vision is of intelligible
 things, not by similitudes, but by their very essences, as he also
 says (Gen. ad lit. xiii, 24, 25). Therefore since God is in our soul
 by His essence, it follows that He is seen by us in His essence.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," According to Dionysius (Coel. Hier. iv) a man is said
 in the Scriptures to see God in the sense that certain figures are
 formed in the senses or imagination, according to some similitude
 representing in part the divinity. So when Jacob says, ""I have seen
 God face to face,"" this does not mean the Divine essence, but some
 figure representing God. And this is to be referred to some high mode
 of prophecy, so that God seems to speak, though in an imaginary
 vision; as will later be explained (II-II, Q. 174) in treating of the
 degrees of prophecy. We may also say that Jacob spoke thus to
 designate some exalted intellectual contemplation, above the ordinary
 state.
"," As God works miracles in corporeal things, so also He
 does supernatural wonders above the common order, raising the minds
 of some living in the flesh beyond the use of sense, even up to the
 vision of His own essence; as Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. xii, 26,
 27, 28) of Moses, the teacher of the Jews; and of Paul, the teacher
 of the Gentiles. This will be treated more fully in the question of
 rapture (II-II, Q. 175).
"," All things are said to be seen in God and all things
 are judged in Him, because by the participation of His light, we know
 and judge all things; for the light of natural reason itself is a
 participation of the divine light; as likewise we are said to see and
 judge of sensible things in the sun, i.e., by the sun's light. Hence
 Augustine says (Soliloq. i, 8), ""The lessons of instruction can only
 be seen as it were by their own sun,"" namely God. As therefore in
 order to see a sensible object, it is not necessary to see the
 substance of the sun, so in like manner to see any intelligible
 object, it is not necessary to see the essence of God.
"," Intellectual vision is of the things which are in the
 soul by their essence, as intelligible things are in the intellect.
 And thus God is in the souls of the blessed; not thus is He in our
 soul, but by presence, essence and power.
",,,,,,,,,,,,
65,"[I, Q. 12, Art. 12]
","Whether God Can Be Known in This Life by Natural Reason?
"," It seems that by natural reason we cannot know God in
 this life. For Boethius says (De Consol. v) that ""reason does not
 grasp simple form."" But God is a supremely simple form, as was shown
 above (Q. 3, A. 7). Therefore natural reason cannot attain to know
 Him.
"," Further, the soul understands nothing by natural reason
 without the use of the imagination. But we cannot have an imagination
 of God, Who is incorporeal. Therefore we cannot know God by natural
 knowledge.
"," Further, the knowledge of natural reason belongs to both
 good and evil, inasmuch as they have a common nature. But the
 knowledge of God belongs only to the good; for Augustine says (De
 Trin. i): ""The weak eye of the human mind is not fixed on that
 excellent light unless purified by the justice of faith."" Therefore
 God cannot be known by natural reason.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Reason cannot reach up to simple form, so as to
 know ""what it is""; but it can know ""whether it is.""
"," God is known by natural knowledge through the
 images of His effects.
"," As the knowledge of God's essence is by grace, it
 belongs only to the good; but the knowledge of Him by natural reason
 can belong to both good and bad; and hence Augustine says (Retract.
 i), retracting what he had said before: ""I do not approve what I said
 in prayer, 'God who willest that only the pure should know truth.'
 For it can be answered that many who are not pure can know many
 truths,"" i.e. by natural reason.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
66,"[I, Q. 12, Art. 13]
","Whether by Grace a Higher Knowledge of God Can Be Obtained Than by
"," It seems that by grace a higher knowledge of God is not
 obtained than by natural reason. For Dionysius says (De Mystica Theol.
 i) that whoever is the more united to God in this life, is united to
 Him as to one entirely unknown. He says the same of Moses, who
 nevertheless obtained a certain excellence by the knowledge conferred
 by grace. But to be united to God while ignoring of Him ""what He is,""
 comes about also by natural reason. Therefore God is not more known to
 us by grace than by natural reason.
"," Further, we can acquire the knowledge of divine things by
 natural reason only through the imagination; and the same applies to
 the knowledge given by grace. For Dionysius says (Coel. Hier. i) that
 ""it is impossible for the divine ray to shine upon us except as
 screened round about by the many colored sacred veils."" Therefore we
 cannot know God more fully by grace than by natural reason.
"," Further, our intellect adheres to God by grace of faith.
 But faith does not seem to be knowledge; for Gregory says (Hom. xxvi
 in Ev.) that ""things not seen are the objects of faith, and not of
 knowledge."" Therefore there is not given to us a more excellent
 knowledge of God by grace.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Although by the revelation of grace in this life we
 cannot know of God ""what He is,"" and thus are united to Him as to one
 unknown; still we know Him more fully according as many and more
 excellent of His effects are demonstrated to us, and according as we
 attribute to Him some things known by divine revelation, to which
 natural reason cannot reach, as, for instance, that God is Three and
 One.
"," From the images either received from sense in the
 natural order, or divinely formed in the imagination, we have so much
 the more excellent intellectual knowledge, the stronger the
 intelligible light is in man; and thus through the revelation given
 by the images a fuller knowledge is received by the infusion of the
 divine light.
"," Faith is a kind of knowledge, inasmuch as the intellect
 is determined by faith to some knowable object. But this
 determination to one object does not proceed from the vision of the
 believer, but from the vision of Him who is believed. Thus as far as
 faith falls short of vision, it falls short of the knowledge which
 belongs to science, for science determines the intellect to one
 object by the vision and understanding of first principles.

67,"[I, Q. 13, Art. 1]
","Whether a Name Can Be Given to God?
"," It seems that no name can be given to God. For Dionysius
 says (Div. Nom. i) that, ""Of Him there is neither name, nor can one be
 found of Him;"" and it is written: ""What is His name, and what is the
 name of His Son, if thou knowest?"" (Prov. 30:4).
"," Further, every name is either abstract or concrete. But
 concrete names do not belong to God, since He is simple, nor do
 abstract names belong to Him, forasmuch as they do not signify any
 perfect subsisting thing. Therefore no name can be said of God.
"," Further, nouns are taken to signify substance with quality;
 verbs and participles signify substance with time; pronouns the same
 with demonstration or relation. But none of these can be applied to
 God, for He has no quality, nor accident, nor time; moreover, He
 cannot be felt, so as to be pointed out; nor can He be described by
 relation, inasmuch as relations serve to recall a thing mentioned
 before by nouns, participles, or demonstrative pronouns. Therefore
 God cannot in any way be named by us.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The reason why God has no name, or is said to be
 above being named, is because His essence is above all that we
 understand about God, and signify in word.
"," Because we know and name God from creatures, the
 names we attribute to God signify what belongs to material creatures,
 of which the knowledge is natural to us. And because in creatures of
 this kind what is perfect and subsistent is compound; whereas their
 form is not a complete subsisting thing, but rather is that whereby a
 thing is; hence it follows that all names used by us to signify a
 complete subsisting thing must have a concrete meaning as applicable
 to compound things; whereas names given to signify simple forms,
 signify a thing not as subsisting, but as that whereby a thing is; as,
 for instance, whiteness signifies that whereby a thing is white. And
 as God is simple, and subsisting, we attribute to Him abstract names
 to signify His simplicity, and concrete names to signify His substance
 and perfection, although both these kinds of names fail to express His
 mode of being, forasmuch as our intellect does not know Him in this
 life as He is.
"," To signify substance with quality is to signify the
 suppositum with a nature or determined form in which it subsists.
 Hence, as some things are said of God in a concrete sense, to signify
 His subsistence and perfection, so likewise nouns are applied to God
 signifying substance with quality. Further, verbs and participles
 which signify time, are applied to Him because His eternity includes
 all time. For as we can apprehend and signify simple subsistences
 only by way of compound things, so we can understand and express
 simple eternity only by way of temporal things, because our intellect
 has a natural affinity to compound and temporal things. But
 demonstrative pronouns are applied to God as describing what is
 understood, not what is sensed. For we can only describe Him as far
 as we understand Him. Thus, according as nouns, participles and
 demonstrative pronouns are applicable to God, so far can He be
 signified by relative pronouns.

","Whether Any Name Can Be Applied to God Substantially?
"," It seems that no name can be applied to God
 substantially. For Damascene says (De Fide Orth. i, 9): ""Everything
 said of God signifies not His substance, but rather shows forth what
 He is not; or expresses some relation, or something following from His
 nature or operation.""
"," Further, Dionysius says (Div. Nom. i): ""You will find a
 chorus of holy doctors addressed to the end of distinguishing clearly
 and praiseworthily the divine processions in the denomination of God.""
 Thus the names applied by the holy doctors in praising God are
 distinguished according to the divine processions themselves. But what
 expresses the procession of anything, does not signify its essence.
 Therefore the names applied to God are not said of Him substantially.
"," Further, a thing is named by us according as we
 understand it. But God is not understood by us in this life in His
 substance. Therefore neither is any name we can use applied
 substantially to God.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Damascene says that these names do not signify what God
 is, forasmuch as by none of these names is perfectly expressed what
 He is; but each one signifies Him in an imperfect manner, even as
 creatures represent Him imperfectly.
"," In the significance of names, that from which the name
 is derived is different sometimes from what it is intended to
 signify, as for instance, this name ""stone"" [lapis] is imposed from
 the fact that it hurts the foot [loedit pedem], but it is not imposed
 to signify that which hurts the foot, but rather to signify a certain
 kind of body; otherwise everything that hurts the foot would be a
 stone [*This refers to the Latin etymology of the word lapis, which
 has no place in English]. So we must say that these kinds of divine
 names are imposed from the divine processions; for as according to
 the diverse processions of their perfections, creatures are the
 representations of God, although in an imperfect manner; so likewise
 our intellect knows and names God according to each kind of
 procession; but nevertheless these names are not imposed to signify
 the procession themselves, as if when we say ""God lives,"" the sense
 were, ""life proceeds from Him""; but to signify the principle itself
 of things, in so far as life pre-exists in Him, although it
 pre-exists in Him in a more eminent way than can be understood or
 signified.
"," We cannot know the essence of God in this life, as He
 really is in Himself; but we know Him accordingly as He is
 represented in the perfections of creatures; and thus the names
 imposed by us signify Him in that manner only.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
69,"[I, Q. 13, Art. 3]
","Whether Any Name Can Be Applied to God in Its Literal Sense?
"," It seems that no name is applied literally to God. For
 all names which we apply to God are taken from creatures; as was
 explained above (A. 1). But the names of creatures are applied to
 God metaphorically, as when we say, God is a stone, or a lion, or the
 like. Therefore names are applied to God in a metaphorical sense.
"," Further, no name can be applied literally to anything if it
 should be withheld from it rather than given to it. But all such
 names as ""good,"" ""wise,"" and the like are more truly withheld from
 God than given to Him; as appears from Dionysius says (Coel. Hier.
 ii). Therefore none of these names belong to God in their literal
 sense.
"," Further, corporeal names are applied to God in a metaphorical
 sense only; since He is incorporeal. But all such names imply some
 kind of corporeal condition; for their meaning is bound up with time
 and composition and like corporeal conditions. Therefore all these
 names are applied to God in a metaphorical sense.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," There are some names which signify these perfections
 flowing from God to creatures in such a way that the imperfect way in
 which creatures receive the divine perfection is part of the very
 signification of the name itself as ""stone"" signifies a material
 being, and names of this kind can be applied to God only in a
 metaphorical sense. Other names, however, express these perfections
 absolutely, without any such mode of participation being part of
 their signification as the words ""being,"" ""good,"" ""living,"" and the
 like, and such names can be literally applied to God.
"," Such names as these, as Dionysius shows, are denied of
 God for the reason that what the name signifies does not belong to
 Him in the ordinary sense of its signification, but in a more eminent
 way. Hence Dionysius says also that God is above all substance and
 all life.
"," These names which are applied to God literally imply
 corporeal conditions not in the thing signified, but as regards their
 mode of signification; whereas those which are applied to God
 metaphorically imply and mean a corporeal condition in the thing
 signified.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
70,"[I, Q. 13, Art. 4]
","Whether Names Applied to God Are Synonymous?
"," It seems that these names applied to God are synonymous
 names. For synonymous names are those which mean exactly the same. But
 these names applied to God mean entirely the same thing in God; for
 the goodness of God is His essence, and likewise it is His wisdom.
 Therefore these names are entirely synonymous.
"," Further, if it be said these names signify one and the same
 thing in reality, but differ in idea, it can be objected that an idea
 to which no reality corresponds is a vain notion. Therefore if these
 ideas are many, and the thing is one, it seems also that all these
 ideas are vain notions.
"," Further, a thing which is one in reality and in idea, is more
 one than what is one in reality and many in idea. But God is
 supremely one. Therefore it seems that He is not one in reality and
 many in idea; and thus the names applied to God do not signify
 different ideas; and thus they are synonymous.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The many aspects of these names are not empty and
 vain, for there corresponds to all of them one simple reality
 represented by them in a manifold and imperfect manner.
"," The perfect unity of God requires that what are
 manifold and divided in others should exist in Him simply and
 unitedly. Thus it comes about that He is one in reality, and yet
 multiple in idea, because our intellect apprehends Him in a manifold
 manner, as things represent Him.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
71,"[I, Q. 13, Art. 5]
","Whether What Is Said of God and of Creatures Is Univocally Predicated
"," It seems that the things attributed to God and creatures
 are univocal. For every equivocal term is reduced to the univocal, as
 many are reduced to one; for if the name ""dog"" be said equivocally of
 the barking dog, and of the dogfish, it must be said of some
 univocally--viz. of all barking dogs; otherwise we proceed to
 infinitude. Now there are some univocal agents which agree with their
 effects in name and definition, as man generates man; and there are
 some agents which are equivocal, as the sun which causes heat,
 although the sun is hot only in an equivocal sense. Therefore it seems
 that the first agent to which all other agents are reduced, is an
 univocal agent: and thus what is said of God and creatures, is
 predicated univocally.
"," Further, there is no similitude among equivocal things.
 Therefore as creatures have a certain likeness to God, according to
 the word of Genesis (Gen. 1:26), ""Let us make man to our image and
 likeness,"" it seems that something can be said of God and creatures
 univocally.
"," Further, measure is homogeneous with the thing measured.
 But God is the first measure of all beings. Therefore God is
 homogeneous with creatures; and thus a word may be applied univocally
 to God and to creatures.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Although equivocal predications must be reduced to
 univocal, still in actions, the non-univocal agent must precede the
 univocal agent. For the non-univocal agent is the universal cause of
 the whole species, as for instance the sun is the cause of the
 generation of all men; whereas the univocal agent is not the
 universal efficient cause of the whole species (otherwise it would be
 the cause of itself, since it is contained in the species), but is a
 particular cause of this individual which it places under the species
 by way of participation. Therefore the universal cause of the whole
 species is not an univocal agent; and the universal cause comes
 before the particular cause. But this universal agent, whilst it is
 not univocal, nevertheless is not altogether equivocal, otherwise it
 could not produce its own likeness, but rather it is to be called an
 analogical agent, as all univocal predications are reduced to one
 first non-univocal analogical predication, which is being.
"," The likeness of the creature to God is imperfect, for
 it does not represent one and the same generic thing (Q. 4, A. 3).
"," God is not the measure proportioned to things measured;
 hence it is not necessary that God and creatures should be in the
 same genus.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
72,"[I, Q. 13, Art. 6]
","Whether Names Predicated of God Are Predicated Primarily of Creatures?
"," It seems that names are predicated primarily of creatures
 rather than of God. For we name anything accordingly as we know it,
 since ""names"", as the Philosopher says, ""are signs of ideas."" But we
 know creatures before we know God. Therefore the names imposed by us
 are predicated primarily of creatures rather than of God.
"," Further, Dionysius says (Div. Nom. i): ""We name God from
 creatures."" But names transferred from creatures to God, are said
 primarily of creatures rather than of God, as ""lion,"" ""stone,"" and the
 like. Therefore all names applied to God and creatures are applied
 primarily to creatures rather than to God.
"," Further, all names equally applied to God and creatures,
 are applied to God as the cause of all creatures, as Dionysius says
 (De Mystica Theol.). But what is applied to anything through its
 cause, is applied to it secondarily, for ""healthy"" is primarily
 predicated of animal rather than of medicine, which is the cause of
 health. Therefore these names are said primarily of creatures rather
 than of God.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," This objection refers to the imposition of the name.
"," The same rule does not apply to metaphorical and
 to other names, as said above.
"," This objection would be valid if these names were
 applied to God only as cause, and not also essentially, for
 instance as ""healthy"" is applied to medicine.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
73,"[I, Q. 13, Art. 7]
","Whether Names Which Imply Relation to Creatures Are Predicated of
"," It seems that names which imply relation to creatures
 are not predicated of God temporally. For all such names signify the
 divine substance, as is universally held. Hence also Ambrose says (De
 Fide i) that this name ""Lord"" is the name of power, which is the
 divine substance; and ""Creator"" signifies the action of God, which is
 His essence. Now the divine substance is not temporal, but eternal.
 Therefore these names are not applied to God temporally, but
 eternally.
"," Further, that to which something applies temporally can be
 described as made; for what is white temporally is made white. But to
 make does not apply to God. Therefore nothing can be predicated of
 God temporally.
"," Further, if any names are applied to God temporally as
 implying relation to creatures, the same rule holds good of all
 things that imply relation to creatures. But some names are spoken of
 God implying relation of God to creatures from eternity; for from
 eternity He knew and loved the creature, according to the word: ""I
 have loved thee with an everlasting love"" (Jer. 31:3). Therefore also
 other names implying relation to creatures, as ""Lord"" and ""Creator,""
 are applied to God from eternity.
"," Further, names of this kind signify relation. Therefore that
 relation must be something in God, or in the creature only. But it
 cannot be that it is something in the creature only, for in that case
 God would be called ""Lord"" from the opposite relation which is in
 creatures; and nothing is named from its opposite. Therefore the
 relation must be something in God also. But nothing temporal can be
 in God, for He is above time. Therefore these names are not applied
 to God temporally.
"," Further, a thing is called relative from relation; for
 instance lord from lordship, as white from whiteness. Therefore if
 the relation of lordship is not really in God, but only in idea, it
 follows that God is not really Lord, which is plainly false.
"," Further, in relative things which are not simultaneous in
 nature, one can exist without the other; as a thing knowable can
 exist without the knowledge of it, as the Philosopher says (Praedic.
 v). But relative things which are said of God and creatures are not
 simultaneous in nature. Therefore a relation can be predicated of God
 to the creature even without the existence of the creature; and thus
 these names ""Lord"" and ""Creator"" are predicated of God from eternity,
 and not temporally.
",,,,,,,,,,,," Some relative names are imposed to signify the
 relative habitudes themselves, as ""master"" and ""servant,"" ""father,""
 and ""son,"" and the like, and these relatives are called predicamental
 [secundum esse]. But others are imposed to signify the things from
 which ensue certain habitudes, as the mover and the thing moved, the
 head and the thing that has a head, and the like: and these relatives
 are called transcendental [secundum dici]. Thus, there is the same
 two-fold difference in divine names. For some signify the habitude
 itself to the creature, as ""Lord,"" and these do not signify the divine
 substance directly, but indirectly, in so far as they presuppose the
 divine substance; as dominion presupposes power, which is the divine
 substance. Others signify the divine essence directly, and
 consequently the corresponding habitudes, as ""Saviour,"" ""Creator,"" and
 suchlike; and these signify the action of God, which is His essence.
 Yet both names are said of God temporarily so far as they imply a
 habitude either principally or consequently, but not as signifying the
 essence, either directly or indirectly.
"," As relations applied to God temporally are only
 in God in our idea, so, ""to become"" or ""to be made"" are applied to God
 only in idea, with no change in Him, as for instance when we say,
 ""Lord, Thou art become [Douay: 'hast been'] our refuge"" (Ps. 89:1).
"," The operation of the intellect and the will is
 in the operator, therefore names signifying relations following upon
 the action of the intellect or will, are applied to God from eternity;
 whereas those following upon the actions proceeding according to our
 mode of thinking to external effects are applied to God temporally, as
 ""Saviour,"" ""Creator,"" and the like.
"," Relations signified by these names which are
 applied to God temporally, are in God only in idea; but the opposite
 relations in creatures are real. Nor is it incongruous that God should
 be denominated from relations really existing in the thing, yet so
 that the opposite relations in God should also be understood by us at
 the same time; in the sense that God is spoken of relatively to the
 creature, inasmuch as the creature is related to Him: thus the
 Philosopher says (Metaph. v) that the object is said to be knowable
 relatively because knowledge relates to it.
"," Since God is related to the creature for the
 reason that the creature is related to Him: and since the relation of
 subjection is real in the creature, it follows that God is Lord not in
 idea only, but in reality; for He is called Lord according to the
 manner in which the creature is subject to Him.
"," To know whether relations are simultaneous by
 nature or otherwise, it is not necessary [to consider the order] of
 things to which they belong but the meaning of the relations
 themselves. For if one in its idea includes another, and vice versa,
 then they are simultaneous by nature: as double and half, father and
 son, and the like. But if one in its idea includes another, and not
 vice versa, they are not simultaneous by nature. This applies to
 science and its object; for the object knowable is considered as a
 potentiality, and the science as a habit, or as an act. Hence the
 knowable object in its mode of signification exists before science,
 but if the same object is considered in act, then it is simultaneous
 with science in act; for the object known is nothing as such unless it
 is known. Thus, though God is prior to the creature, still because the
 signification of Lord includes the idea of a servant and vice versa,
 these two relative terms, ""Lord"" and ""servant,"" are simultaneous by
 nature. Hence, God was not ""Lord"" until He had a creature subject to
 Himself.

74,"[I, Q. 13, Art. 8]
","Whether This Name ""God"" Is a Name of the Nature?
"," It seems that this name, ""God,"" is not a name of the
 nature. For Damascene says (De Fide Orth. 1) that ""God (Theos) is so
 called from theein which means to take care of, and to cherish all
 things; or from aithein that is, to burn, for our God is a fire
 consuming all malice; or from theasthai, which means to consider all
 things."" But all these names belong to operation. Therefore this name
 ""God"" signifies His operation and not His nature.
"," Further, a thing is named by us as we know it. But the
 divine nature is unknown to us. Therefore this name ""God"" does not
 signify the divine nature.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,," All that Damascene says refers to providence; which is
 the source of the signification of the name ""God.""
"," We can name a thing according to the knowledge we have
 of its nature from its properties and effects. Hence because we can
 know what stone is in itself from its property, this name ""stone""
 signifies the nature of the stone itself; for it signifies the
 definition of stone, by which we know what it is, for the idea which
 the name signifies is the definition, as is said in Metaph. iv. Now
 from the divine effects we cannot know the divine nature in itself,
 so as to know what it is; but only by way of eminence, and by way of
 causality, and of negation as stated above (Q. 12, A. 12). Thus the
 name ""God"" signifies the divine nature, for this name was imposed to
 signify something existing above all things, the principle of all
 things and removed from all things; for those who name God intend to
 signify all this.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
75,"[I, Q. 13, Art. 9]
","Whether This Name ""God"" Is Communicable?
"," It seems that this name ""God"" is communicable. For
 whosoever shares in the thing signified by a name shares in the name
 itself. But this name ""God"" signifies the divine nature, which is
 communicable to others, according to the words, ""He hath given us
 great [Vulg.: 'most great'] and precious promises, that by these we
 [Vulg.: 'ye'] may be made partakers of the divine nature"" (2 Pet.
 1:4). Therefore this name ""God"" can be communicated to others.
"," Further, only proper names are not communicable. Now this
 name ""God"" is not a proper, but an appellative noun; which appears
 from the fact that it has a plural, according to the text, ""I have
 said, You are gods"" (Ps. 81:6). Therefore this name ""God"" is
 communicable.
"," Further, this name ""God"" comes from operation, as explained.
 But other names given to God from His operations or effects are
 communicable; as ""good,"" ""wise,"" and the like. Therefore this name
 ""God"" is communicable.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The divine nature is only communicable according to the
 participation of some similitude.
"," This name ""God"" is an appellative name, and not a
 proper name, for it signifies the divine nature in the possessor;
 although God Himself in reality is neither universal nor particular.
 For names do not follow upon the mode of being in things, but upon
 the mode of being as it is in our mind. And yet it is incommunicable
 according to the truth of the thing, as was said above concerning the
 name ""sun.""
"," These names ""good,"" ""wise,"" and the like, are imposed
 from the perfections proceeding from God to creatures; but they do
 not signify the divine nature, but rather signify the perfections
 themselves absolutely; and therefore they are in truth communicable
 to many. But this name ""God"" is given to God from His own proper
 operation, which we experience continually, to signify the divine
 nature.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
76,"[I, Q. 13, Art. 10]
","Whether This Name ""God"" Is Applied to God Univocally by Nature,
"," It seems that this name ""God"" is applied to God
 univocally by nature, by participation, and according to opinion. For
 where a diverse signification exists, there is no contradiction of
 affirmation and negation; for equivocation prevents contradiction. But
 a Catholic who says: ""An idol is not God,"" contradicts a pagan who
 says: ""An idol is God."" Therefore ""God"" in both senses is spoken of
 univocally.
"," Further, as an idol is God in opinion, and not in truth,
 so the enjoyment of carnal pleasures is called happiness in opinion,
 and not in truth. But this name ""beatitude"" is applied univocally to
 this supposed happiness, and also to true happiness. Therefore also
 this name ""God"" is applied univocally to the true God, and to God also
 in opinion.
"," Further, names are called univocal because they contain one
 idea. Now when a Catholic says: ""There is one God,"" he understands by
 the name God an omnipotent being, and one venerated above all; while
 the heathen understands the same when he says: ""An idol is God.""
 Therefore this name ""God"" is applied univocally to both.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The multiplication of names does not depend on the
 predication of the name, but on the signification: for this name
 ""man,"" of whomsoever it is predicated, whether truly or falsely, is
 predicated in one sense. But it would be multiplied if by the name
 ""man"" we meant to signify different things; for instance, if one
 meant to signify by this name ""man"" what man really is, and another
 meant to signify by the same name a stone, or something else. Hence
 it is evident that a Catholic saying that an idol is not God
 contradicts the pagan asserting that it is God; because each of them
 uses this name ""God"" to signify the true God. For when the pagan says
 an idol is God, he does not use this name as meaning God in opinion,
 for he would then speak the truth, as also Catholics sometimes use
 the name in that sense, as in the Psalm, ""All the gods of the
 Gentiles are demons"" (Ps. 95:5).
"," The term ""animal"" applied
 to a true and a pictured animal is not purely equivocal; for the
 Philosopher takes equivocal names in a large sense, including
 analogous names; because also being, which is predicated
 analogically, is sometimes said to be predicated equivocally of
 different predicaments.
"," Neither a Catholic nor a
 pagan knows the very nature of God as it is in itself; but each one
 knows it according to some idea of causality, or excellence, or
 remotion (Q. 12, A. 12). So a pagan can take this name ""God"" in the
 same way when he says an idol is God, as the Catholic does in saying
 an idol is not God. But if anyone should be quite ignorant of God
 altogether, he could not even name Him, unless, perhaps, as we use
 names the meaning of which we know not.

 WHO IS is not the most proper name of God.

78,"[I, Q. 13, Art. 12]
","Whether Affirmative Propositions Can Be Formed About God?
"," It seems that affirmative propositions cannot be formed
 about God. For Dionysius says (Coel. Hier. ii) that ""negations about
 God are true; but affirmations are vague.""
"," Further, Boethius says (De Trin. ii) that ""a simple form
 cannot be a subject."" But God is the most absolutely simple form, as
 shown (Q. 3): therefore He cannot be a subject. But everything about
  which an affirmative proposition is made is taken as a subject.
 Therefore an affirmative proposition cannot be formed about God.
"," Further, every intellect is false which understands a
 thing otherwise than as it is. But God has existence without any
 composition as shown above (Q. 3, A. 7). Therefore since every
 affirmative intellect understands something as compound, it follows
 that a true affirmative proposition about God cannot be made.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Dionysius says that the affirmations about God
 are vague or, according to another translation, ""incongruous,""
 inasmuch as no name can be applied to God according to its mode of
 signification.
"," Our intellect cannot comprehend simple subsisting
 forms, as they really are in themselves; but it apprehends them as
 compound things in which there is something taken as subject and
 something that is inherent. Therefore it apprehends the simple form
 as a subject, and attributes something else to it.
"," This proposition, ""The intellect understanding anything
 otherwise than it is, is false,"" can be taken in two senses,
 accordingly as this adverb ""otherwise"" determines the word
 ""understanding"" on the part of the thing understood, or on the part
 of the one who understands. Taken as referring to the thing
 understood, the proposition is true, and the meaning is: Any
 intellect which understands that the thing is otherwise than it is,
 is false. But this does not hold in the present case; because our
 intellect, when forming a proposition about God, does not affirm that
 He is composite, but that He is simple. But taken as referring to the
 one who understands, the proposition is false. For the mode of the
 intellect in understanding is different from the mode of the thing in
 its essence. Since it is clear that our intellect understands
 material things below itself in an immaterial manner; not that it
 understands them to be immaterial things; but its manner of
 understanding is immaterial. Likewise, when it understands simple
 things above itself, it understands them according to its own mode,
 which is in a composite manner; yet not so as to understand them to
 be composite things. And thus our intellect is not false in forming
 composition in its ideas concerning God.

79,"[I, Q. 14, Art. 1]
","Whether There Is Knowledge [*Scientia] in God?
"," It seems that in God there is not knowledge. For
 knowledge is a habit; and habit does not belong to God, since it is
 the mean between potentiality and act. Therefore knowledge is not in
 God.
"," Further, since science is about conclusions, it is a kind of
 knowledge caused by something else which is the knowledge of
 principles. But nothing is caused in God; therefore science is not in
 God.
"," Further, all knowledge is universal, or particular. But in God
 there is no universal or particular (Q. 3, A. 5). Therefore in God
 there is not knowledge.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Because perfections flowing from God to creatures exist
 in a higher state in God Himself (Q. 4, A. 2), whenever a name taken
 from any created perfection is attributed to God, it must be
 separated in its signification from anything that belongs to that
 imperfect mode proper to creatures. Hence knowledge is not a quality
 of God, nor a habit; but substance and pure act.
"," Whatever is divided and multiplied in creatures exists
 in God simply and unitedly (Q. 13, A. 4). Now man has different kinds
 of knowledge, according to the different objects of His knowledge. He
 has intelligence as regards the knowledge of principles; he has
 science as regards knowledge of conclusions; he has wisdom,
 according as he knows the highest cause; he has counsel or
 prudence, according as he knows what is to be done. But God knows
 all these by one simple act of knowledge, as will be shown (A. 7).
 Hence the simple knowledge of God can be named by all these names; in
 such a way, however, that there must be removed from each of them, so
 far as they enter into divine predication, everything that savors of
 imperfection; and everything that expresses perfection is to be
 retained in them. Hence it is said, ""With Him is wisdom and strength,
 He hath counsel and understanding"" (Job 12:13).
"," Knowledge is according to the mode of the one who
 knows; for the thing known is in the knower according to the mode of
 the knower. Now since the mode of the divine essence is higher than
 that of creatures, divine knowledge does not exist in God after the
 mode of created knowledge, so as to be universal or particular, or
 habitual, or potential, or existing according to any such mode.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
80,"[I, Q. 14, Art. 2]
","Whether God Understands Himself?
"," It seems that God does not understand Himself. For it is
 said by the Philosopher (De Causis), ""Every knower who knows his own
 essence, returns completely to his own essence."" But God does not go
 out from His own essence, nor is He moved at all; thus He cannot
 return to His own essence. Therefore He does not know His own essence.
"," Further, to understand is a kind of passion and movement,
 as the Philosopher says (De Anima iii); and knowledge also is a kind
 of assimilation to the object known; and the thing known is the
 perfection of the knower. But nothing is moved, or suffers, or is made
 perfect by itself, ""nor,"" as Hilary says (De Trin. iii), ""is a thing
 its own likeness."" Therefore God does not understand Himself.
"," Further, we are like to God chiefly in our intellect,
 because we are the image of God in our mind, as Augustine says (Gen.
 ad lit. vi). But our intellect understands itself, only as it
 understands other things, as is said in De Anima iii. Therefore God
 understands Himself only so far perchance as He understands other
 things.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Return to its own essence means only that a thing
 subsists in itself. Inasmuch as the form perfects the matter by
 giving it existence, it is in a certain way diffused in it; and it
 returns to itself inasmuch as it has existence in itself. Therefore
 those cognitive faculties which are not subsisting, but are the acts
 of organs, do not know themselves, as in the case of each of the
 senses; whereas those cognitive faculties which are subsisting, know
 themselves; hence it is said in De Causis that, ""whoever knows his
 essence returns to it."" Now it supremely belongs to God to be
 self-subsisting. Hence according to this mode of speaking, He
 supremely returns to His own essence, and knows Himself.
"," Movement and passion are taken equivocally, according
 as to understand is described as a kind of movement or passion, as
 stated in De Anima iii. For to understand is not a movement that is
 an act of something imperfect passing from one to another, but it is
 an act, existing in the agent itself, of something perfect. Likewise
 that the intellect is perfected by the intelligible object, i.e. is
 assimilated to it, this belongs to an intellect which is sometimes in
 potentiality; because the fact of its being in a state of
 potentiality makes it differ from the intelligible object and
 assimilates it thereto through the intelligible species, which is the
 likeness of the thing understood, and makes it to be perfected
 thereby, as potentiality is perfected by act. On the other hand, the
 divine intellect, which is no way in potentiality, is not perfected
 by the intelligible object, nor is it assimilated thereto, but is its
 own perfection, and its own intelligible object.
"," Existence in nature does not belong to primary matter,
 which is a potentiality, unless it is reduced to act by a form. Now
 our passive intellect has the same relation to intelligible objects
 as primary matter has to natural things; for it is in potentiality as
 regards intelligible objects, just as primary matter is to natural
 things. Hence our passive intellect can be exercised concerning
 intelligible objects only so far as it is perfected by the
 intelligible species of something; and in that way it understands
 itself by an intelligible species, as it understands other things:
 for it is manifest that by knowing the intelligible object it
 understands also its own act of understanding, and by this act knows
 the intellectual faculty. But God is a pure act in the order of
 existence, as also in the order of intelligible objects; therefore He
 understands Himself through Himself.

","Whether God Comprehends Himself?
"," It seems that God does not comprehend Himself. For
 Augustine says (Octog. Tri. Quaest. xv), that ""whatever comprehends
 itself is finite as regards itself."" But God is in all ways infinite.
 Therefore He does not comprehend Himself.
"," If it is said that God is infinite to us, and finite to
 Himself, it can be urged to the contrary, that everything in God is
 truer than it is in us. If therefore God is finite to Himself, but
 infinite to us, then God is more truly finite than infinite; which is
 against what was laid down above (Q. 7, A. 1). Therefore God does
 not comprehend Himself.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The strict meaning of ""comprehension"" signifies that
 one thing holds and includes another; and in this sense everything
 comprehended is finite, as also is everything included in another.
 But God is not said to be comprehended by Himself in this sense, as
 if His intellect were a faculty apart from Himself, and as if it held
 and included Himself; for these modes of speaking are to be taken by
 way of negation. But as God is said to be in Himself, forasmuch as He
 is not contained by anything outside of Himself; so He is said to be
 comprehended by Himself, forasmuch as nothing in Himself is hidden
 from Himself. For Augustine says (De Vid. Deum. ep. cxii), ""The whole
 is comprehended when seen, if it is seen in such a way that nothing
 of it is hidden from the seer.""
"," When it is said, ""God is finite to Himself,"" this is to
 be understood according to a certain similitude of proportion,
 because He has the same relation in not exceeding His intellect, as
 anything finite has in not exceeding finite intellect. But God is not
 to be called finite to Himself in this sense, as if He understood
 Himself to be something finite.

","Whether the Act of God's Intellect Is His Substance?
"," It seems that the act of God's intellect is not His
 substance. For to understand is an operation. But an operation
 signifies something proceeding from the operator. Therefore the act of
 God's intellect is not His substance.
"," Further, to understand one's act of understanding, is to
 understand something that is neither great nor chiefly understood,
 but secondary and accessory. If therefore God be his own act of
 understanding, His act of understanding will be as when we understand
 our act of understanding: and thus God's act of understanding will not
 be something great.
"," Further, every act of understanding means understanding
 something. When therefore God understands Himself, if He Himself is
 not distinct from this act of understanding, He understands that He
 understands Himself; and so on to infinity. Therefore the act of God's
 intellect is not His substance.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," To understand is not an operation proceeding out of the
 operator, but remaining in him.
"," When that act of understanding which is not subsistent
 is understood, something not great is understood; as when we
 understand our act of understanding; and so this cannot be likened to
 the act of the divine understanding which is subsistent.

83,"[I, Q. 14, Art. 5]
","Whether God Knows Things Other Than Himself?
"," It seems that God does not know things besides Himself.
 For all other things but God are outside of God. But Augustine says
 (Octog. Tri. Quaest. qu. xlvi) that ""God does not behold anything out
 of Himself."" Therefore He does not know things other than Himself.
"," Further, the object understood is the perfection of the one
 who understands. If therefore God understands other things besides
 Himself, something else will be the perfection of God, and will be
 nobler than He; which is impossible.
"," Further, the act of understanding is specified by the
 intelligible object, as is every other act from its own object. Hence
 the intellectual act is so much the nobler, the nobler the object
 understood. But God is His own intellectual act. If therefore God
 understands anything other than Himself, then God Himself is specified
 by something else than Himself; which cannot be. Therefore He does not
 understand things other than Himself.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The passage of Augustine in which it is said that God
 ""sees nothing outside Himself"" is not to be taken in such a way, as
 if God saw nothing outside Himself, but in the sense that what is
 outside Himself He does not see except in Himself, as above explained.
"," The object understood is a perfection of the one
 understanding not by its substance, but by its image, according to
 which it is in the intellect, as its form and perfection, as is said
 in De Anima iii. For ""a stone is not in the soul, but its image.""
 Now those things which are other than God are understood by God,
 inasmuch as the essence of God contains their images as above
 explained; hence it does not follow that there is any perfection in
 the divine intellect other than the divine essence.
"," The intellectual act is not specified by what is
 understood in another, but by the principal object understood in which
 other things are understood. For the intellectual act is specified by
 its object, inasmuch as the intelligible form is the principle of the
 intellectual operation: since every operation is specified by the form
 which is its principle of operation; as heating by heat. Hence the
 intellectual operation is specified by that intelligible form which
 makes the intellect in act. And this is the image of the principal
 thing understood, which in God is nothing but His own essence in which
 all images of things are comprehended. Hence it does not follow that
 the divine intellectual act, or rather God Himself, is specified by
 anything else than the divine essence itself.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
84,"[I, Q. 14, Art. 6]
","Whether God Knows Things Other Than Himself by Proper Knowledge?
"," It seems that God does not know things other than
 Himself by proper knowledge. For, as was shown (A. 5), God knows
 things other than Himself, according as they are in Himself. But
 other things are in Him as in their common and universal cause, and
 are known by God as in their first and universal cause. This is to
 know them by general, and not by proper knowledge. Therefore God
 knows things besides Himself by general, and not by proper knowledge.
"," Further, the created essence is as distant from the divine
 essence, as the divine essence is distant from the created essence.
 But the divine essence cannot be known by the created essence, as
 said above (Q. 12, A. 2). Therefore neither can the created essence
 be known by the divine essence. Thus as God knows only by His
 essence, it follows that He does not know what the creature is in its
 essence, so as to know ""what it is,"" which is to have proper
 knowledge of it.
"," Further, proper knowledge of a thing can come only through
 its proper ratio [i.e., concept]. But as God knows all things by His
 essence, it seems that He does not know each thing by its proper
 ratio; for one thing cannot be the proper ratio of many and diverse
 things. Therefore God has not a proper knowledge of things, but a
 general knowledge; for to know things otherwise than by their proper
 ratio is to have only a common and general knowledge of them.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," So to know a thing as it is in the knower, may be
 understood in two ways. In one way this adverb ""so"" imports the mode
 of knowledge on the part of the thing known; and in that sense it is
 false. For the knower does not always know the object known according
 to the existence it has in the knower; since the eye does not know a
 stone according to the existence it has in the eye; but by the image
 of the stone which is in the eye, the eye knows the stone according
 to its existence outside the eye. And if any knower has a knowledge
 of the object known according to the (mode of) existence it has in
 the knower, the knower nevertheless knows it according to its (mode
 of) existence outside the knower; thus the intellect knows a stone
 according to the intelligible existence it has in the intellect,
 inasmuch as it knows that it understands; while nevertheless it knows
 what a stone is in its own nature. If however the adverb 'so' be
 understood to import the mode (of knowledge) on the part of the
 knower, in that sense it is true that only the knower has knowledge
 of the object known as it is in the knower; for the more perfectly
 the thing known is in the knower, the more perfect is the mode of
 knowledge.
"," The created essence is compared to the essence of God
 as the imperfect to the perfect act. Therefore the created essence
 cannot sufficiently lead us to the knowledge of the divine essence,
 but rather the converse.
"," The same thing cannot be taken in an equal manner as
 the ratio of different things. But the divine essence excels all
 creatures. Hence it can be taken as the proper ratio of each thing
 according to the diverse ways in which diverse creatures participate
 in, and imitate it.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
85,"[I, Q. 14, Art. 7]
","Whether the Knowledge of God Is Discursive?
"," It seems that the knowledge of God is discursive. For the
 knowledge of God is not habitual knowledge, but actual knowledge. Now
 the Philosopher says (Topic. ii): ""The habit of knowledge may regard
 many things at once; but actual understanding regards only one thing
 at a time."" Therefore as God knows many things, Himself and others, as
 shown above (AA. 2, 5), it seems that He does not understand all at
 once, but discourses from one to another.
"," Further, discursive knowledge is to know the effect through
 its cause. But God knows things through Himself; as an effect (is
 known) through its cause. Therefore His knowledge is discursive.
"," Further, God knows each creature more perfectly than we know
 it. But we know the effects in their created causes; and thus we go
 discursively from causes to things caused. Therefore it seems that
 the same applies to God.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Although there is only one act of understanding in
 itself, nevertheless many things may be understood in one (medium),
 as shown above.
"," God does not know by their cause, known, as it were
 previously, effects unknown; but He knows the effects in the cause;
 and hence His knowledge is not discursive, as was shown above.
"," God sees the effects of created causes in the causes
 themselves, much better than we can; but still not in such a manner
 that the knowledge of the effects is caused in Him by the knowledge
 of the created causes, as is the case with us; and hence His
 knowledge is not discursive.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
86,"[I, Q. 14, Art. 8]
","Whether the Knowledge of God Is the Cause of Things?
"," It seems that the knowledge of God is not the cause of
 things. For Origen says, on Rom. 8:30, ""Whom He called, them He also
 justified,"" etc.: ""A thing will happen not because God knows it as
 future; but because it is future, it is on that account known by God,
 before it exists.""
"," Further, given the cause, the effect follows. But the
 knowledge of God is eternal. Therefore if the knowledge of God is
 the cause of things created, it seems that creatures are eternal.
"," Further, ""The thing known is prior to knowledge, and is
 its measure,"" as the Philosopher says (Metaph. x). But what is
 posterior and measured cannot be a cause. Therefore the knowledge
 of God is not the cause of things.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Origen spoke in reference to that aspect of knowledge
 to which the idea of causality does not belong unless the will is
 joined to it, as is said above.
"," The knowledge of God is the cause of things according
 as things are in His knowledge. Now that things should be eternal was
 not in the knowledge of God; hence although the knowledge of God is
 eternal, it does not follow that creatures are eternal.
"," Natural things are midway between the knowledge of God
 and our knowledge: for we receive knowledge from natural things, of
 which God is the cause by His knowledge. Hence, as the natural
 objects of knowledge are prior to our knowledge, and are its measure,
 so, the knowledge of God is prior to natural things, and is the
 measure of them; as, for instance, a house is midway between the
 knowledge of the builder who made it, and the knowledge of the one
 who gathers his knowledge of the house from the house already built.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
87,"[I, Q. 14, Art. 9]
","Whether God Has Knowledge of Things That Are Not?
"," It seems that God has not knowledge of things that are
 not. For the knowledge of God is of true things. But ""truth"" and
 ""being"" are convertible terms. Therefore the knowledge of God is not
 of things that are not.
"," Further, knowledge requires likeness between the knower and
 the thing known. But those things that are not cannot have any
 likeness to God, Who is very being. Therefore what is not, cannot be
 known by God.
"," Further, the knowledge of God is the cause of what is known
 by Him. But it is not the cause of things that are not, because a
 thing that is not, has no cause. Therefore God has no knowledge of
 things that are not.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Those things that are not actual are true in so far as
 they are in potentiality; for it is true that they are in
 potentiality; and as such they are known by God.
"," Since God is very being everything is, in so far as it
 participates in the likeness of God; as everything is hot in so far
 as it participates in heat. So, things in potentiality are known by
 God, although they are not in act.
"," The knowledge of God, joined to His will is the cause
 of things. Hence it is not necessary that what ever God knows, is, or
 was, or will be; but only is this necessary as regards what He wills
 to be, or permits to be. Further, it is in the knowledge of God not
 that they be, but that they be possible.

88,"[I, Q. 14, Art. 10]
","Whether God Knows Evil Things?
"," It seems that God does not know evil things. For the
 Philosopher (De Anima iii) says that the intellect which is not in
 potentiality does not know privation. But ""evil is the privation of
 good,"" as Augustine says (Confess. iii, 7). Therefore, as the
 intellect of God is never in potentiality, but is always in act, as is
 clear from the foregoing (A. 2), it seems that God does not know evil
 things.
"," Further, all knowledge is either the cause of the thing
 known, or is caused by it. But the knowledge of God is not the cause
 of evil, nor is it caused by evil. Therefore God does not know evil
 things.
"," Further, everything known is known either by its likeness,
 or by its opposite. But whatever God knows, He knows through His
 essence, as is clear from the foregoing (A. 5). Now the divine
 essence neither is the likeness of evil, nor is evil contrary to it;
 for to the divine essence there is no contrary, as Augustine says (De
 Civ. Dei xii). Therefore God does not know evil things.
"," Further, what is known through another and not through
 itself, is imperfectly known. But evil is not known by God; for the
 thing known must be in the knower. Therefore if evil is known through
 another, namely, through good, it would be known by Him imperfectly;
 which cannot be, for the knowledge of God is not imperfect. Therefore
 God does not know evil things.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," The saying of the Philosopher must be understood as
 meaning that the intellect which is not in potentiality, does not
 know privation by privation existing in it; and this agrees with what
 he said previously, that a point and every indivisible thing are
 known by privation of division. This is because simple and
 indivisible forms are in our intellect not actually, but only
 potentially; for were they actually in our intellect, they would not
 be known by privation. It is thus that simple things are known by
 separate substances. God therefore knows evil, not by privation
 existing in Himself, but by the opposite good.
"," The knowledge of God is not the cause of evil; but is
 the cause of the good whereby evil is known.
"," Although evil is not opposed to the divine essence,
 which is not corruptible by evil; it is opposed to the effects of
 God, which He knows by His essence; and knowing them, He knows the
 opposite evils.
"," To know a thing by something else only, belongs to
 imperfect knowledge, if that thing is of itself knowable; but evil is
 not of itself knowable, forasmuch as the very nature of evil means
 the privation of good; therefore evil can neither be defined nor
 known except by good.

89,"[I, Q. 14, Art. 11]
","Whether God Knows Singular Things?
"," It seems that God does not know singular things. For the
 divine intellect is more immaterial than the human intellect. Now the
 human intellect by reason of its immateriality does not know singular
 things; but as the Philosopher says (De Anima ii), ""reason has to do
 with universals, sense with singular things."" Therefore God does not
 know singular things.
"," Further, in us those faculties alone know the singular, which
 receive the species not abstracted from material conditions. But in
 God things are in the highest degree abstracted from all materiality.
 Therefore God does not know singular things.
"," Further, all knowledge comes about through the medium of some
 likeness. But the likeness of singular things in so far as they are
 singular, does not seem to be in God; for the principle of
 singularity is matter, which, since it is in potentiality only, is
 altogether unlike God, Who is pure act. Therefore God cannot know
 singular things.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Our intellect abstracts the intelligible species from
 the individualizing principles; hence the intelligible species in our
 intellect cannot be the likeness of the individual principles; and on
 that account our intellect does not know the singular. But the
 intelligible species in the divine intellect, which is the essence of
 God, is immaterial not by abstraction, but of itself, being the
 principle of all the principles which enter into the composition of
 things, whether principles of the species or principles of the
 individual; hence by it God knows not only universal, but also
 singular things.
"," Although as regards the species in the divine intellect
 its being has no material conditions like the images received in the
 imagination and sense, yet its power extends to both immaterial and
 material things.
"," Although matter as regards its potentiality recedes
 from likeness to God, yet, even in so far as it has being in this
 wise, it retains a certain likeness to the divine being.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
90,"[I, Q. 14, Art. 12]
","Whether God Can Know Infinite Things?
"," It seems that God cannot know infinite things. For the
 infinite, as such, is unknown; since the infinite is that which, ""to
 those who measure it, leaves always something more to be measured,""
 as the Philosopher says (Phys. iii). Moreover, Augustine says (De
 Civ. Dei xii) that ""whatever is comprehended by knowledge, is bounded
 by the comprehension of the knower."" Now infinite things have no
 boundary. Therefore they cannot be comprehended by the knowledge of
 God.
"," Further, if we say that things infinite in themselves are
 finite in God's knowledge, against this it may be urged that the
 essence of the infinite is that it is untraversable, and the finite
 that it is traversable, as said in Phys. iii. But the infinite is
 not traversable either by the finite or by the infinite, as is proved
 in Phys. vi. Therefore the infinite cannot be bounded by the finite,
 nor even by the infinite; and so the infinite cannot be finite in
 God's knowledge, which is infinite.
"," Further, the knowledge of God is the measure of what is
 known. But it is contrary to the essence of the infinite that it be
 measured. Therefore infinite things cannot be known by God.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The idea of the infinite pertains to quantity, as the
 Philosopher says (Phys. i). But the idea of quantity implies the
 order of parts. Therefore to know the infinite according to the mode
 of the infinite is to know part after part; and in this way the
 infinite cannot be known; for whatever quantity of parts be taken,
 there will always remain something else outside. But God does not
 know the infinite or infinite things, as if He enumerated part after
 part; since He knows all things simultaneously, and not successively,
 as said above (A. 7). Hence there is nothing to prevent Him from
 knowing infinite things.
"," Transition imports a certain succession of parts; and
 hence it is that the infinite cannot be traversed by the finite, nor
 by the infinite. But equality suffices for comprehension, because
 that is said to be comprehended which has nothing outside the
 comprehender. Hence it is not against the idea of the infinite to be
 comprehended by the infinite. And so, what is infinite in itself can
 be called finite to the knowledge of God as comprehended; but not as
 if it were traversable.
"," The knowledge of God is the measure of things, not
 quantitatively, for the infinite is not subject to this kind of
 measure; but it is the measure of the essence and truth of things.
 For everything has truth of nature according to the degree in which
 it imitates the knowledge of God, as the thing made by art agrees
 with the art. Granted, however, an actually infinite number of
 things, for instance, an infinitude of men, or an infinitude in
 continuous quantity, as an infinitude of air, as some of the ancients
 held; yet it is manifest that these would have a determinate and
 finite being, because their being would be limited to some
 determinate nature. Hence they would be measurable as regards the
 knowledge of God.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
91,"[I, Q. 14, Art. 13]
","Whether the Knowledge of God Is of Future Contingent Things?
"," It seems that the knowledge of God is not of future
 contingent things. For from a necessary cause proceeds a necessary
 effect. But the knowledge of God is the cause of things known, as said
 above (A. 8). Since therefore that knowledge is necessary, what He
 knows must also be necessary. Therefore the knowledge of God is not of
 contingent things.
"," Further, every conditional proposition of which the
 antecedent is absolutely necessary must have an absolutely necessary
 consequent. For the antecedent is to the consequent as principles are
 to the conclusion: and from necessary principles only a necessary
 conclusion can follow, as is proved in Poster. i. But this is a true
 conditional proposition, ""If God knew that this thing will be, it will
 be,"" for the knowledge of God is only of true things. Now the
 antecedent conditional of this is absolutely necessary, because it is
 eternal, and because it is signified as past. Therefore the consequent
 is also absolutely necessary. Therefore whatever God knows, is
 necessary; and so the knowledge of God is not of contingent things.
"," Further, everything known by God must necessarily be,
 because even what we ourselves know, must necessarily be; and, of
 course, the knowledge of God is much more certain than ours. But no
 future contingent things must necessarily be. Therefore no contingent
 future thing is known by God.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Although the supreme cause is necessary, the effect may
 be contingent by reason of the proximate contingent cause; just as
 the germination of a plant is contingent by reason of the proximate
 contingent cause, although the movement of the sun which is the first
 cause, is necessary. So likewise things known by God are contingent
 on account of their proximate causes, while the knowledge of God,
 which is the first cause, is necessary.
"," Some say that this antecedent, ""God knew this
 contingent to be future,"" is not necessary, but contingent; because,
 although it is past, still it imports relation to the future. This
 however does not remove necessity from it; for whatever has had
 relation to the future, must have had it, although the future
 sometimes does not follow. On the other hand some say that this
 antecedent is contingent, because it is a compound of necessary and
 contingent; as this saying is contingent, ""Socrates is a white man.""
 But this also is to no purpose; for when we say, ""God knew this
 contingent to be future,"" contingent is used here only as the matter
 of the word, and not as the chief part of the proposition. Hence its
 contingency or necessity has no reference to the necessity or
 contingency of the proposition, or to its being true or false. For it
 may be just as true that I said a man is an ass, as that I said
 Socrates runs, or God is: and the same applies to necessary and
 contingent. Hence it must be said that this antecedent is absolutely
 necessary. Nor does it follow, as some say, that the consequent is
 absolutely necessary, because the antecedent is the remote cause of
 the consequent, which is contingent by reason of the proximate cause.
 But this is to no purpose. For the conditional would be false were
 its antecedent the remote necessary cause, and the consequent a
 contingent effect; as, for example, if I said, ""if the sun moves, the
 grass will grow.""
"," Things reduced to act in time, as known by us
 successively in time, but by God (are known) in eternity, which is
 above time. Whence to us they cannot be certain, forasmuch as we know
 future contingent things as such; but (they are certain) to God
 alone, whose understanding is in eternity above time. Just as he who
 goes along the road, does not see those who come after him; whereas
 he who sees the whole road from a height, sees at once all travelling
 by the way. Hence what is known by us must be necessary, even as it
 is in itself; for what is future contingent in itself, cannot be
 known by us. Whereas what is known by God must be necessary according
 to the mode in which they are subject to the divine knowledge, as
 already stated, but not absolutely as considered in their own causes.
 Hence also this proposition, ""Everything known by God must
 necessarily be,"" is usually distinguished; for this may refer to the
 thing, or to the saying. If it refers to the thing, it is divided and
 false; for the sense is, ""Everything which God knows is necessary.""
 If understood of the saying, it is composite and true; for the sense
 is, ""This proposition, 'that which is known by God is' is necessary.""

","Whether God Knows Enunciable Things?

 He is altogether simple. Therefore God does not know enunciable

","Whether the Knowledge of God Is Variable?
"," It seems that the knowledge of God is variable. For
 knowledge is related to what is knowable. But whatever imports
 relation to the creature is applied to God from time, and varies
 according to the variation of creatures. Therefore the knowledge of
 God is variable according to the variation of creatures.
"," Further, whatever God can make, He can know. But God can
 make more than He does. Therefore He can know more than He knows.
 Thus His knowledge can vary according to increase and diminution.
"," Further, God knew that Christ would be born. But He does
 not know now that Christ will be born; because Christ is not to be
 born in the future. Therefore God does not know everything He once
 knew; and thus the knowledge of God is variable.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," ""Lord"", ""Creator"" and the like, import relations to
 creatures in so far as they are in themselves. But the knowledge of
 God imports relation to creatures in so far as they are in God;
 because everything is actually understood according as it is in the
 one who understands. Now created things are in God in an invariable
 manner; while they exist variably in themselves. We may also say that
 ""Lord"", ""Creator"" and the like, import the relations consequent upon
 the acts which are understood as terminating in the creatures
 themselves, as they are in themselves; and thus these relations are
 attributed to God variously, according to the variation of creatures.
 But ""knowledge"" and ""love,"" and the like, import relations consequent
 upon the acts which are understood to be in God; and therefore these
 are predicated of God in an invariable manner.
"," God knows also what He can make, and does not make.
 Hence from the fact that He can make more than He makes, it does not
 follow that He can know more than He knows, unless this be referred
 to the knowledge of vision, according to which He is said to know
 those things which are in act in some period of time. But from the
 fact that He knows some things might be which are not, or that some
 things might not be which are, it does not follow that His knowledge
 is variable, but rather that He knows the variability of things. If,
 however, anything existed which God did not previously know, and
 afterwards knew, then His knowledge would be variable. But this could
 not be; for whatever is, or can be in any period of time, is known by
 God in His eternity. Therefore from the fact that a thing exists in
 some period of time, it follows that it is known by God from
 eternity. Therefore it cannot be granted that God can know more than
 He knows; because such a proposition implies that first of all He did
 not know, and then afterwards knew.
"," The ancient Nominalists said that it was the same thing
 to say ""Christ is born"" and ""will be born"" and ""was born""; because
 the same thing is signified by these three--viz. the nativity of
 Christ. Therefore it follows, they said, that whatever God knew, He
 knows; because now He knows that Christ is born, which means the same
 thing as that Christ will be born. This opinion, however, is false;
 both because the diversity in the parts of a sentence causes a
 diversity of enunciations; and because it would follow that a
 proposition which is true once would be always true; which is
 contrary to what the Philosopher lays down (Categor. iii) when he
 says that this sentence, ""Socrates sits,"" is true when he is sitting,
 and false when he rises up. Therefore, it must be conceded that this
 proposition is not true, ""Whatever God knew He knows,"" if referred to
 enunciable propositions. But because of this, it does not follow that
 the knowledge of God is variable. For as it is without variation in
 the divine knowledge that God knows one and the same thing sometime
 to be, and sometime not to be, so it is without variation in the
 divine knowledge that God knows an enunciable proposition is sometime
 true, and sometime false. The knowledge of God, however, would be
 variable if He knew enunciable things by way of enunciation, by
 composition and division, as occurs in our intellect. Hence our
 knowledge varies either as regards truth and falsity, for example, if
 when either as regards truth and falsity, for example, if when a
 thing suffers change we retained the same opinion about it; or as
 regards diverse opinions, as if we first thought that anyone was
 sitting, and afterwards thought that he was not sitting; neither of

","Whether God Has a Speculative Knowledge of Things?
"," It seems that God has not a speculative knowledge of
 things. For the knowledge of God is the cause of things, as shown
 above (A. 8). But speculative knowledge is not the cause of the
 things known. Therefore the knowledge of God is not speculative.
"," Further, speculative knowledge comes by abstraction from
 things; which does not belong to the divine knowledge. Therefore the
 knowledge of God is not speculative.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The knowledge of God is the cause, not indeed of
 Himself, but of other things. He is actually the cause of some, that
 is, of things that come to be in some period of time; and He is
 virtually the cause of others, that is, of things which He can make,
 and which nevertheless are never made.
"," The fact that knowledge is derived from things known
 does not essentially belong to speculative knowledge, but only
 accidentally in so far as it is human.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
95,"[I, Q. 15, Art. 1]
","Whether There Are Ideas?
"," It seems that there are no ideas. For Dionysius says
 (Div. Nom. vii), that God does not know things by ideas. But ideas
 are for nothing else except that things may be known through them.
 Therefore there are no ideas.
"," Further, God knows all things in Himself, as has been
 already said (Q. 14, A. 5). But He does not know Himself through
 an idea; neither therefore other things.
"," Further, an idea is considered to be the principle of
 knowledge and action. But the divine essence is a sufficient
 principle of knowing and effecting all things. It is not therefore
 necessary to suppose ideas.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," God does not understand things according to an idea
 existing outside Himself. Thus Aristotle (Metaph. ix) rejects the
 opinion of Plato, who held that ideas existed of themselves, and not
 in the intellect.
"," Although God knows Himself and all else by His own
 essence, yet His essence is the operative principle of all things,
 except of Himself. It has therefore the nature of an idea with
 respect to other things; though not with respect to Himself.
"," God is the similitude of all things according to His
 essence; therefore an idea in God is identical with His essence.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
96,"[I, Q. 15, Art. 2]
","Whether Ideas Are Many?
"," It seems that ideas are not many. For an idea in God is
 His essence. But God's essence is one only. Therefore there is only
 one idea.
"," Further, as the idea is the principle of knowing and
 operating, so are art and wisdom. But in God there are not several
 arts or wisdoms. Therefore in Him there is no plurality of ideas.
"," Further, if it be said that ideas are multiplied according to
 their relations to different creatures, it may be argued on the
 contrary that the plurality of ideas is eternal. If, then, ideas are
 many, but creatures temporal, then the temporal must be the cause of
 the eternal.
"," Further, these relations are either real in creatures only,
 or in God also. If in creatures only, since creatures are not from
 eternity, the plurality of ideas cannot be from eternity, if ideas
 are multiplied only according to these relations. But if they are
 real in God, it follows that there is a real plurality in God other
 than the plurality of Persons: and this is against the teaching of
 Damascene (De Fide Orth. i, 10), who says, in God all things are one,
 except ""ingenerability, generation, and procession."" Ideas therefore
 are not many.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," The divine essence is not called an idea in so far as
 it is that essence, but only in so far as it is the likeness or type
 of this or that thing. Hence ideas are said to be many, inasmuch as
 many types are understood through the self-same essence.
"," By wisdom and art we signify that by which God
 understands; but an idea, that which God understands. For God by one
 understands many things, and that not only according to what they are
 in themselves, but also according as they are understood, and this is
 to understand the several types of things. In the same way, an
 architect is said to understand a house, when he understands the form
 of the house in matter. But if he understands the form of a house, as
 devised by himself, from the fact that he understands that he
 understands it, he thereby understands the type or idea of the house.
 Now not only does God understand many things by His essence, but He
 also understands that He understands many things by His essence. And
 this means that He understands the several types of things; or that
 many ideas are in His intellect as understood by Him.
"," Such relations, whereby ideas are multiplied, are
 caused not by the things themselves, but by the divine intellect
 comparing its own essence with these things.
"," Relations multiplying ideas do not exist in created
 things, but in God. Yet they are not real relations, such as those
 whereby the Persons are distinguished, but relations understood by
 God.
",,,,,,,,,,,,
97,"[I, Q. 15, Art. 3]
","Whether There Are Ideas of All Things That God Knows?
"," It seems that there are not ideas in God of all things
 that He knows. For the idea of evil is not in God; since it would
 follow that evil was in Him. But evil things are known by God.
 Therefore there are not ideas of all things that God knows.
"," Further, God knows things that neither are, nor will be,
 nor have been, as has been said above (A. 9). But of such things
 there are no ideas, since, as Dionysius says (Div. Nom. v): ""Acts of
 the divine will are the determining and effective types of things.""
 Therefore there are not in God ideas of all things known by Him.
"," Further, God knows primary matter, of which there can be
 no idea, since it has no form. Hence the same conclusion.
"," Further, it is certain that God knows not only species, but
 also genera, singulars, and accidents. But there are not ideas of
 these, according to Plato's teaching, who first taught ideas, as
 Augustine says (Octog. Tri. Quaest. qu. xlvi). Therefore there are
 not ideas in God of all things known by Him.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," Evil is known by God not through its own type, but
 through the type of good. Evil, therefore, has no idea in God,
 neither in so far as an idea is an ""exemplar"" nor as a ""type.""
"," God has no practical knowledge, except virtually, of
 things which neither are, nor will be, nor have been. Hence, with
 respect to these there is no idea in God in so far as idea signifies
 an ""exemplar"" but only in so far as it denotes a ""type.""
"," Plato is said by some to have considered matter as not
 created; and therefore he postulated not an idea of matter but a
 concause with matter. Since, however, we hold matter to be created by
 God, though not apart from form, matter has its idea in God; but not
 apart from the idea of the composite; for matter in itself can
 neither exist, nor be known.
"," Genus can have no idea apart from the idea of species,
 in so far as idea denotes an ""exemplar""; for genus cannot exist
 except in some species. The same is the case with those accidents
 that inseparably accompany their subject; for these come into being
 along with their subject. But accidents which supervene to the
 subject, have their special idea. For an architect produces through
 the form of the house all the accidents that originally accompany it;
 whereas those that are superadded to the house when completed, such
 as painting, or any other such thing, are produced through some other
 form. Now individual things, according to Plato, have no other idea
 than that of species; both because particular things are
 individualized by matter, which, as some say, he held to be uncreated
 and the concause with the idea; and because the intention of nature
 regards the species, and produces individuals only that in them the
 species may be preserved. However, divine providence extends not
 merely to species; but to individuals as will be shown later (Q. 22,
 A. 3).

98,"[I, Q. 16, Art. 1]
","Whether Truth Resides Only in the Intellect?
"," It seems that truth does not reside only in the
 intellect, but rather in things. For Augustine (Soliloq. ii, 5)
 condemns this definition of truth, ""That is true which is seen""; since
 it would follow that stones hidden in the bosom of the earth would not
 be true stones, as they are not seen. He also condemns the following,
 ""That is true which is as it appears to the knower, who is willing and
 able to know,"" for hence it would follow that nothing would be true,
 unless someone could know it. Therefore he defines truth thus: ""That
 is true which is."" It seems, then, that truth resides in things, and
 not in the intellect.
"," Further, whatever is true, is true by reason of truth. If,
 then, truth is only in the intellect, nothing will be true except in
 so far as it is understood. But this is the error of the ancient
 philosophers, who said that whatever seems to be true is so.
 Consequently mutual contradictories seem to be true as seen by
 different persons at the same time.
"," Further, ""that, on account of which a thing is so, is itself
 more so,"" as is evident from the Philosopher (Poster. i). But it is
 from the fact that a thing is or is not, that our thought or word is
 true or false, as the Philosopher teaches (Praedicam. iii). Therefore
 truth resides rather in things than in the intellect.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Augustine is speaking about the truth of things, and
 excludes from the notion of this truth, relation to our intellect;
 for what is accidental is excluded from every definition.
"," The ancient philosophers held that the species of
 natural things did not proceed from any intellect, but were produced
 by chance. But as they saw that truth implies relation to intellect,
 they were compelled to base the truth of things on their relation to
 our intellect. From this, conclusions result that are inadmissible,
 and which the Philosopher refutes (Metaph. iv). Such, however, do not
 follow, if we say that the truth of things consists in their relation
 to the divine intellect.
"," Although the truth of our intellect is caused by the
 thing, yet it is not necessary that truth should be there primarily,
 any more than that health should be primarily in medicine, rather
 than in the animal: for the virtue of medicine, and not its health,
 is the cause of health, for here the agent is not univocal. In the
 same way, the being of the thing, not its truth, is the cause of
 truth in the intellect. Hence the Philosopher says that a thought or
 a word is true ""from the fact that a thing is, not because a thing is
 true.""
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
99,"[I, Q. 16, Art. 2]
","Whether Truth Resides Only in the Intellect Composing and Dividing?
"," It seems that truth does not reside only in the intellect
 composing and dividing. For the Philosopher says (De Anima iii) that
 as the senses are always true as regards their proper sensible
 objects, so is the intellect as regards ""what a thing is."" Now
 composition and division are neither in the senses nor in the
 intellect knowing ""what a thing is."" Therefore truth does not reside
 only in the intellect composing and dividing.
"," Further, Isaac says in his book On Definitions that truth
 is the equation of thought and thing. Now just as the intellect with
 regard to complex things can be equated to things, so also with regard
 to simple things; and this is true also of sense apprehending a thing
 as it is. Therefore truth does not reside only in the intellect
 composing and dividing.

100,"[I, Q. 16, Art. 3]
","Whether the True and Being Are Convertible Terms?
"," It seems that the true and being are not convertible
 terms. For the true resides properly in the intellect, as stated
 (A. 1); but being is properly in things. Therefore they are not
 convertible.
"," Further, that which extends to being and not-being is not
 convertible with being. But the true extends to being and not-being;
 for it is true that what is, is; and that what is not, is not.
 Therefore the true and being are not convertible.
"," Further, things which stand to each other in order of
 priority and posteriority seem not to be convertible. But the true
 appears to be prior to being; for being is not understood except
 under the aspect of the true. Therefore it seems they are not
 convertible.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The true resides in things and in the intellect, as
 said before (A. 1). But the true that is in things is convertible
 with being as to substance; while the true that is in the intellect
 is convertible with being, as the manifestation with the manifested;
 for this belongs to the nature of truth, as has been said already (A.
 1). It may, however, be said that being also is in things and in the
 intellect, as is the true; although truth is primarily in the
 intellect, while being is primarily in things; and this is so because
 truth and being differ in idea.
"," Not-being has nothing in itself whereby it can be
 known; yet it is known in so far as the intellect renders it
 knowable. Hence the true is based on being, inasmuch as not-being is
 a kind of logical being, apprehended, that is, by reason.
"," When it is said that being cannot be apprehended except
 under the notion of the true, this can be understood in two ways. In
 the one way so as to mean that being is not apprehended, unless the
 idea of the true follows apprehension of being; and this is true. In
 the other way, so as to mean that being cannot be apprehended unless
 the idea of the true be apprehended also; and this is false. But the
 true cannot be apprehended unless the idea of being be apprehended
 also; since being is included in the idea of the true. The case is
 the same if we compare the intelligible object with being. For being
 cannot be understood, unless being is intelligible. Yet being can be
 understood while its intelligibility is not understood. Similarly,
 being when understood is true, yet the true is not understood by
 understanding being.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
101,"[I, Q. 16, Art. 4]
","Whether Good Is Logically Prior to the True?
"," It seems that good is logically prior to the true. For
 what is more universal is logically prior, as is evident from Phys.
 i. But the good is more universal than the true, since the true is a
 kind of good, namely, of the intellect. Therefore the good is
 logically prior to the true.
"," Further, good is in things, but the true in the intellect
 composing and dividing as said above (A. 2). But that which is in
 things is prior to that which is in the intellect. Therefore good is
 logically prior to the true.
"," Further, truth is a species of virtue, as is clear from
 Ethic. iv. But virtue is included under good; since, as Augustine
 says (De Lib. Arbit. ii, 19), it is a good quality of the mind.
 Therefore the good is prior to the true.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The will and the intellect mutually include one
 another: for the intellect understands the will, and the will wills
 the intellect to understand. So then, among things directed to the
 object of the will, are comprised also those that belong to the
 intellect; and conversely. Whence in the order of things desirable,
 good stands as the universal, and the true as the particular; whereas
 in the order of intelligible things the converse is the case. From the
 fact, then, that the true is a kind of good, it follows that the good
 is prior in the order of things desirable; but not that it is prior
 absolutely.
"," A thing is prior logically in so far as it is prior to
 the intellect. Now the intellect apprehends primarily being itself;
 secondly, it apprehends that it understands being; and thirdly, it
 apprehends that it desires being. Hence the idea of being is first,
 that of truth second, and the idea of good third, though good is in
 things.
"," The virtue which is called ""truth"" is not truth in
 general, but a certain kind of truth according to which man shows
 himself in deed and word as he really is. But truth as applied to
 ""life"" is used in a particular sense, inasmuch as a man fulfills in
 his life that to which he is ordained by the divine intellect, as it
 has been said that truth exists in other things (A. 1). Whereas the
 truth of ""justice"" is found in man as he fulfills his duty to his
 neighbor, as ordained by law. Hence we cannot argue from these
 particular truths to truth in general.

102,"[I, Q. 16, Art. 5]
","Whether God Is Truth?
"," It seems that God is not truth. For truth consists in the
 intellect composing and dividing. But in God there is not composition
 and division. Therefore in Him there is not truth.
"," Further, truth, according to Augustine (De Vera Relig. xxxvi)
 is a ""likeness to the principle."" But in God there is no likeness to
 a principle. Therefore in God there is not truth.
"," Further, whatever is said of God, is said of Him as of the
 first cause of all things; thus the being of God is the cause of all
 being; and His goodness the cause of all good. If therefore there is
 truth in God, all truth will be from Him. But it is true that someone
 sins. Therefore this will be from God; which is evidently false.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Although in the divine intellect there is neither
 composition nor division, yet in His simple act of intelligence He
 judges of all things and knows all things complex; and thus there is
 truth in His intellect.
"," The truth of our intellect is according to its
 conformity with its principle, that is to say, to the things from
 which it receives knowledge. The truth also of things is according to
 their conformity with their principle, namely, the divine intellect.
 Now this cannot be said, properly speaking, of divine truth; unless
 perhaps in so far as truth is appropriated to the Son, Who has a
 principle. But if we speak of divine truth in its essence, we cannot
 understand this unless the affirmative must be resolved into the
 negative, as when one says: ""the Father is of Himself, because He is
 not from another."" Similarly, the divine truth can be called a
 ""likeness to the principle,"" inasmuch as His existence is not
 dissimilar to His intellect.
"," Not-being and privation have no truth of themselves,
 but only in the apprehension of the intellect. Now all apprehension
 of the intellect is from God. Hence all the truth that exists in the
 statement--""that a person commits fornication is true""--is entirely
 from God. But to argue, ""Therefore that this person fornicates is
 from God"", is a fallacy of Accident.

103,"[I, Q. 16, Art. 6]
","Whether There Is Only One Truth, According to Which All Things Are True?
"," It seems that there is only one truth, according to which
 all things are true. For according to Augustine (De Trin. xv, 1),
 ""nothing is greater than the mind of man, except God."" Now truth is
 greater than the mind of man; otherwise the mind would be the judge of
 truth: whereas in fact it judges all things according to truth, and
 not according to its own measure. Therefore God alone is truth.
 Therefore there is no other truth but God.
"," Further, Anselm says (De Verit. xiv), that, ""as is the
 relation of time to temporal things, so is that of truth to true
 things."" But there is only one time for all temporal things.
 Therefore there is only one truth, by which all things are true.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The soul does not judge of things according to any kind
 of truth, but according to the primary truth, inasmuch as it is
 reflected in the soul, as in a mirror, by reason of the first
 principles of the understanding. It follows, therefore, that the
 primary truth is greater than the soul. And yet, even created truth,
 which resides in our intellect, is greater than the soul, not simply,
 but in a certain degree, in so far as it is its perfection; even as
 science may be said to be greater than the soul. Yet it is true that
 nothing subsisting is greater than the rational soul, except God.
"," The saying of Anselm is correct in so far as things are
 said to be true by their relation to the divine intellect.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
104,"[I, Q. 16, Art. 7]
","Whether Created Truth Is Eternal?
"," It seems that created truth is eternal. For Augustine
 says (De Lib. Arbit. ii, 8) ""Nothing is more eternal than the nature
 of a circle, and that two added to three make five."" But the truth of
 these is a created truth. Therefore created truth is eternal.
"," Further, that which is always, is eternal. But universals
 are always and everywhere; therefore they are eternal. So therefore
 is truth, which is the most universal.
"," Further, it was always true that what is true in the present
 was to be in the future. But as the truth of a proposition regarding
 the present is a created truth, so is that of a proposition regarding
 the future. Therefore some created truth is eternal.
"," Further, all that is without beginning and end is eternal.
 But the truth of enunciables is without beginning and end; for if
 their truth had a beginning, since it was not before, it was true
 that truth was not, and true, of course, by reason of truth; so that
 truth was before it began to be. Similarly, if it be asserted that
 truth has an end, it follows that it is after it has ceased to be,
 for it will still be true that truth is not. Therefore truth is
 eternal.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," The nature of a circle, and the fact that two and three
 make five, have eternity in the mind of God.
"," That something is always and everywhere, can be
 understood in two ways. In one way, as having in itself the power of
 extension to all time and to all places, as it belongs to God to be
 everywhere and always. In the other way as not having in itself
 determination to any place or time, as primary matter is said to be
 one, not because it has one form, but by the absence of all
 distinguishing form. In this manner all universals are said to be
 everywhere and always, in so far as universals are independent of
 place and time. It does not, however, follow from this that they are
 eternal, except in an intellect, if one exists that is eternal.
"," That which now is, was future, before it (actually)
 was; because it was in its cause that it would be. Hence, if the
 cause were removed, that thing's coming to be was not future. But the
 first cause is alone eternal. Hence it does not follow that it was
 always true that what now is would be, except in so far as its future
 being was in the sempiternal cause; and God alone is such a cause.
"," Because our intellect is not eternal, neither is the
 truth of enunciable propositions which are formed by us, eternal, but
 it had a beginning in time. Now before such truth existed, it was not
 true to say that such a truth did exist, except by reason of the
 divine intellect, wherein alone truth is eternal. But it is true now
 to say that that truth did not then exist: and this is true only by
 reason of the truth that is now in our intellect; and not by reason
 of any truth in the things. For this is truth concerning not-being;
 and not-being has not truth of itself, but only so far as our
 intellect apprehends it. Hence it is true to say that truth did not
 exist, in so far as we apprehend its not-being as preceding its being.
",,,,,,,,,,,,
105,"[I, Q. 16, Art. 8]
","Whether Truth Is Immutable?
"," It seems that truth is immutable. For Augustine says (De
 Lib. Arbit. ii, 12), that ""Truth and mind do not rank as equals,
 otherwise truth would be mutable, as the mind is.""
"," Further, what remains after every change is immutable; as
 primary matter is unbegotten and incorruptible, since it remains after
 all generation and corruption. But truth remains after all change; for
 after every change it is true to say that a thing is, or is not.
 Therefore truth is immutable.
"," Further, if the truth of an enunciation changes, it changes
 mostly with the changing of the thing. But it does not thus change.
 For truth, according to Anselm (De Verit. viii), ""is a certain
 rightness"" in so far as a thing answers to that which is in the
 divine mind concerning it. But this proposition that ""Socrates sits"",
 receives from the divine mind the signification that Socrates does
 sit; and it has the same signification even though he does not sit.
 Therefore the truth of the proposition in no way changes.
"," Further, where there is the same cause, there is the same
 effect. But the same thing is the cause of the truth of the three
 propositions, ""Socrates sits, will sit, sat."" Therefore the truth of
 each is the same. But one or other of these must be the true one.
 Therefore the truth of these propositions remains immutable; and for
 the same reason that of any other.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," Augustine is speaking of divine truth.
"," The true and being are convertible terms. Hence just as
 being is not generated nor corrupted of itself, but accidentally, in
 so far as this being or that is corrupted or generated, as is said in
 Phys. i, so does truth change, not so as that no truth remains, but
 because that truth does not remain which was before.
"," A proposition not only has truth, as other things are
 said to have it, in so far, that is, as they correspond to that which
 is the design of the divine intellect concerning them; but it is said
 to have truth in a special way, in so far as it indicates the truth
 of the intellect, which consists in the conformity of the intellect
 with a thing. When this disappears, the truth of an opinion changes,
 and consequently the truth of the proposition. So therefore this
 proposition, ""Socrates sits,"" is true, as long as he is sitting, both
 with the truth of the thing, in so far as the expression is
 significative, and with the truth of signification, in so far as it
 signifies a true opinion. When Socrates rises, the first truth
 remains, but the second is changed.
"," The sitting of Socrates, which is the cause of the
 truth of the proposition, ""Socrates sits,"" has not the same meaning
 when Socrates sits, after he sits, and before he sits. Hence the
 truth which results, varies, and is variously signified by these
 propositions concerning present, past, or future. Thus it does not
 follow, though one of the three propositions is true, that the same
 truth remains invariable.

"," It appears that falsity does not exist in things. For
 Augustine says (Soliloq. ii, 8), ""If the true is that which is, it
 will be concluded that the false exists nowhere; whatever reason may
 appear to the contrary.""
"," Further, false is derived from fallere (to deceive). But
 things do not deceive; for, as Augustine says (De Vera Relig. 33),
 they show nothing but their own species. Therefore the false is not
 found in things.
"," Further, the true is said to exist in things by conformity to
 the divine intellect, as stated above (Q. 16). But everything, in so

 non-being, so in things that are is found a degree of falseness.
"," Things do not deceive by their own nature, but by
 accident. For they give occasion to falsity, by the likeness they
 bear to things which they actually are not.

","Whether There Is Falsity in the Senses?
"," It seems that falsity is not in the senses. For Augustine
 says (De Vera Relig. 33): ""If all the bodily senses report as they are
 affected, I do not know what more we can require from them."" Thus it
 seems that we are not deceived by the senses; and therefore that
 falsity is not in them.
"," Further, the Philosopher says (Metaph. iv, 24) that falsity
 is not proper to the senses, but to the imagination.
"," Further, in non-complex things there is neither true nor
 false, but in complex things only. But affirmation and negation do
 not belong to the senses. Therefore in the senses there is no falsity.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The affection of sense is its sensation itself. Hence,
 from the fact that sense reports as it is affected, it follows that
 we are not deceived in the judgment by which we judge that we
 experience sensation. Since, however, sense is sometimes affected
 erroneously of that object, it follows that it sometimes reports
 erroneously of that object; and thus we are deceived by sense about
 the object, but not about the fact of sensation.
"," Falsity is said not to be proper to sense, since sense
 is not deceived as to its proper object. Hence in another translation
 it is said more plainly, ""Sense, about its proper object, is never
 false."" Falsity is attributed to the imagination, as it represents
 the likeness of something even in its absence. Hence, when anyone
 perceives the likeness of a thing as if it were the thing itself,
 falsity results from such an apprehension; and for this reason the
 Philosopher says (Metaph. v, 34) that shadows, pictures, and dreams
 are said to be false inasmuch as they convey the likeness of things
 that are not present in substance.
"," This argument proves that the false is not in the
 sense, as in that which knows the true and the false.

 Augustine says (Qq. lxxxiii, 32), ""Everyone who is deceived,
 understands not that in which he is deceived."" But falsity is said to
 exist in any knowledge in so far as we are deceived therein. Therefore
 falsity does not exist in the intellect.
"," Further, the Philosopher says (De Anima iii, 51) that the
 intellect is always right. Therefore there is no falsity in the
 intellect.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Because the essence of a thing is the proper object of
 the intellect, we are properly said to understand a thing when we
 reduce it to its essence, and judge of it thereby; as takes place in
 demonstrations, in which there is no falsity. In this sense
 Augustine's words must be understood, ""that he who is deceived,
 understands not that wherein he is deceived;"" and not in the sense
 that no one is ever deceived in any operation of the intellect.
"," The intellect is always right as regards first
 principles; since it is not deceived about them for the same reason
 that it is not deceived about what a thing is. For self-known
 principles are such as are known as soon as the terms are understood,
 from the fact that the predicate is contained in the definition of
 the subject.

 ""truth,"" as Augustine says (Soliloq. ii, 5), ""is that which is."" But
 that which is and that which is not are not opposed as contraries.
 Therefore true and false are not contrary things.

 ""A tragedian would not be a false Hector, if he were not a true
 tragedian."" Therefore true and false are not contraries.
"," Further, in God there is no contrariety, for ""nothing is
 contrary to the Divine Substance,"" as Augustine says (De Civ. Dei
 xii, 2). But falsity is opposed to God, for an idol is called in
 Scripture a lie, ""They have laid hold on lying"" (Jer. 8:5), that is
 to say, ""an idol,"" as a gloss says. Therefore false and true are not
 contraries.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," What is in things is the truth of the thing; but what
 is apprehended, is the truth of the intellect, wherein truth
 primarily resides. Hence the false is that which is not as
 apprehended. To apprehend being, and not-being, implies contrariety;
 for, as the Philosopher proves (Peri Herm. ii), the contrary of this
 statement ""God is good,"" is, ""God is not good.""
"," Falsity is not founded in the truth which is contrary
 to it, just as evil is not founded in the good which is contrary to
 it, but in that which is its proper subject. This happens in either,
 because true and good are universals, and convertible with being.
 Hence, as every privation is founded in a subject, that is a being,
 so every evil is founded in some good, and every falsity in some
 truth.
"," Because contraries, and opposites by way of privation,
 are by nature about one and the same thing, therefore there is
 nothing contrary to God, considered in Himself, either with respect
 to His goodness or His truth, for in His intellect there can be
 nothing false. But in our apprehension of Him contraries exist, for
 the false opinion concerning Him is contrary to the true. So idols
 are called lies, opposed to the divine truth, inasmuch as the false
 opinion concerning them is contrary to the true opinion of the divine
 unity.

110,"[I, Q. 18, Art. 1]
","Whether to Live Belongs to All Natural Things?
"," It seems that to live belongs to all natural things. For
 the Philosopher says (Phys. viii, 1) that ""Movement is like a kind of
 life possessed by all things existing in nature."" But all natural
 things participate in movement. Therefore all natural things partake
 of life.
"," Further, plants are said to live, inasmuch as they have in
 themselves a principle of movement of growth and decay. But local
 movement is naturally more perfect than, and prior to, movement of
 growth and decay, as the Philosopher shows (Phys. viii, 56, 57).
 Since then, all natural bodies have in themselves some principle of
 local movement, it seems that all natural bodies live.
"," Further, amongst natural bodies the elements are the less
 perfect. Yet life is attributed to them, for we speak of ""living
 waters."" Much more, therefore, have other natural bodies life.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," These words of the Philosopher may be understood either
 of the first movement, namely, that of the celestial bodies, or of
 the movement in its general sense. In either way is movement called
 the life, as it were, of natural bodies, speaking by a similitude,
 and not attributing it to them as their property. The movement of the
 heavens is in the universe of corporeal natures as the movement of
 the heart, whereby life is preserved, is in animals. Similarly also
 every natural movement in respect to natural things has a certain
 similitude to the operations of life. Hence, if the whole corporeal
 universe were one animal, so that its movement came from an
 ""intrinsic moving force,"" as some in fact have held, in that case
 movement would really be the life of all natural bodies.
"," To bodies, whether heavy or light, movement does not
 belong, except in so far as they are displaced from their natural
 conditions, and are out of their proper place; for when they are in
 the place that is proper and natural to them, then they are at rest.
 Plants and other living things move with vital movement, in
 accordance with the disposition of their nature, but not by
 approaching thereto, or by receding from it, for in so far as they
 recede from such movement, so far do they recede from their natural
 disposition. Heavy and light bodies are moved by an extrinsic force,
 either generating them and giving them form, or removing obstacles
 from their way. They do not therefore move themselves, as do living
 bodies.
"," Waters are called living that have a continuous
 current: for standing waters, that are not connected with a
 continually flowing source, are called dead, as in cisterns and
 ponds. This is merely a similitude, inasmuch as the movement they are
 seen to possess makes them look as if they were alive. Yet this is
 not life in them in its real sense, since this movement of theirs is
 not from themselves but from the cause that generates them. The same
 is the case with the movement of other heavy and light bodies.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
111,"[I, Q. 18, Art. 2]
","Whether Life Is an Operation?
"," It seems that life is an operation. For nothing is
 divided except into parts of the same genus. But life is divided by
 certain operations, as is clear from the Philosopher (De Anima ii,
 13), who distinguishes four kinds of life, namely, nourishment,
 sensation, local movement and understanding. Therefore life is an
 operation.
"," Further, the active life is said to be different from the
 contemplative. But the contemplative is only distinguished from the
 active by certain operations. Therefore life is an operation.
"," Further, to know God is an operation. But this is life,
 as is clear from the words of John 18:3, ""Now this is eternal life,
 that they may know Thee, the only true God."" Therefore life is an
 operation.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The Philosopher here takes ""to live"" to mean an
 operation of life. Or it would be better to say that sensation and
 intelligence and the like, are sometimes taken for the operations,
 sometimes for the existence itself of the operator. For he says
 (Ethic. ix, 9) that to live is to sense or to understand--in other
 words, to have a nature capable of sensation or understanding. Thus,
 then, he distinguishes life by the four operations mentioned. For in
 this lower world there are four kinds of living things. It is the
 nature of some to be capable of nothing more than taking nourishment,
 and, as a consequence, of growing and generating. Others are able, in
 addition, to sense, as we see in the case of shellfish and other
 animals without movement. Others have the further power of moving from
 place to place, as perfect animals, such as quadrupeds, and birds, and
 so on. Others, as man, have the still higher faculty of understanding.
"," By vital operations are meant those whose principles
 are within the operator, and in virtue of which the operator produces
 such operations of itself. It happens that there exist in men not
 merely such natural principles of certain operations as are their
 natural powers, but something over and above these, such as habits
 inclining them like a second nature to particular kinds of
 operations, so that the operations become sources of pleasure. Thus,
 as by a similitude, any kind of work in which a man takes delight, so
 that his bent is towards it, his time spent in it, and his whole life
 ordered with a view to it, is said to be the life of that man. Hence
 some are said to lead a life of self-indulgence, others a life of
 virtue. In this way the contemplative life is distinguished from the
 active, and thus to know God is said to be life eternal.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
112,"[I, Q. 18, Art. 3]
","Whether Life Is Properly Attributed to God?
"," It seems that life is not properly attributed to God.
 For things are said to live inasmuch as they move themselves, as
 previously stated (A. 2). But movement does not belong to God.
 Neither therefore does life.
"," Further, in all living things we must needs suppose some
 principle of life. Hence it is said by the Philosopher (De Anima ii,
 4) that ""the soul is the cause and principle of the living body."" But
 God has no principle. Therefore life cannot be attributed to Him.
"," Further, the principle of life in the living things that
 exist among us is the vegetative soul. But this exists only in
 corporeal things. Therefore life cannot be attributed to incorporeal
 things.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," As stated in Metaph. ix, 16, action is twofold. Actions
 of one kind pass out to external matter, as to heat or to cut; whilst
 actions of the other kind remain in the agent, as to understand, to
 sense and to will. The difference between them is this, that the
 former action is the perfection not of the agent that moves, but of
 the thing moved; whereas the latter action is the perfection of the
 agent. Hence, because movement is an act of the thing in movement,
 the latter action, in so far as it is the act of the operator, is
 called its movement, by this similitude, that as movement is an act
 of the thing moved, so an act of this kind is the act of the agent,
 although movement is an act of the imperfect, that is, of what is in
 potentiality; while this kind of act is an act of the perfect, that
 is to say, of what is in act as stated in De Anima iii, 28. In the
 sense, therefore, in which understanding is movement, that which
 understands itself is said to move itself. It is in this sense that
 Plato also taught that God moves Himself; not in the sense in which
 movement is an act of the imperfect.
"," As God is His own very existence and understanding, so
 is He His own life; and therefore He so lives that He has no
 principle of life.
"," Life in this lower world is bestowed on a corruptible
 nature, that needs generation to preserve the species, and
 nourishment to preserve the individual. For this reason life is not
 found here below apart from a vegetative soul: but this does not hold
 good with incorruptible natures.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
113,"[I, Q. 18, Art. 4]
","Whether All Things Are Life in God?
"," It seems that not all things are life in God. For it is
 said (Acts 17:28), ""In Him we live, and move, and be."" But not all
 things in God are movement. Therefore not all things are life in Him.
"," Further, all things are in God as their first model. But
 things modelled ought to conform to the model. Since, then, not all
 things have life in themselves, it seems that not all things are life
 in God.
"," Further, as Augustine says (De Vera Relig. 29), a living
 substance is better than a substance that does not live. If,
 therefore, things which in themselves have not life, are life in God,
 it seems that things exist more truly in God than themselves. But this
 appears to be false; since in themselves they exist actually, but in
 God potentially.
"," Further, just as good things and things made in time are
 known by God, so are bad things, and things that God can make, but
 that never will be made. If, therefore, all things are life in God,
 inasmuch as known by Him, it seems that even bad things and things
 that will never be made are life in God, as known by Him, and this
 appears inadmissible.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," Creatures are said to be in God in a twofold sense. In
 one way, so far are they are held together and preserved by the
 divine power; even as we say that things that are in our power are in
 us. And creatures are thus said to be in God, even as they exist in
 their own natures. In this sense we must understand the words of the
 Apostle when he says, ""In Him we live, move, and be""; since our
 being, living, and moving are themselves caused by God. In another
 sense things are said to be in God, as in Him who knows them, in
 which sense they are in God through their proper ideas, which in God
 are not distinct from the divine essence. Hence things as they are in
 God are the divine essence. And since the divine essence is life and
 not movement, it follows that things existing in God in this manner
 are not movement, but life.
"," The thing modelled must be like the model according to
 the form, not the mode of being. For sometimes the form has being of
 another kind in the model from that which it has in the thing
 modelled. Thus the form of a house has in the mind of the architect
 immaterial and intelligible being; but in the house that exists
 outside his mind, material and sensible being. Hence the ideas of
 things, though not existing in themselves, are life in the divine
 mind, as having a divine existence in that mind.
"," If form only, and not matter, belonged to natural
 things, then in all respects natural things would exist more truly in
 the divine mind, by the ideas of them, than in themselves. For which
 reason, in fact, Plato held that the separate man was the true man;
 and that man as he exists in matter, is man only by participation.
 But since matter enters into the being of natural things, we must say
 that those things have simply being in the divine mind more truly
 than in themselves, because in that mind they have an uncreated
 being, but in themselves a created being: whereas this particular
 being, a man, or horse, for example, has this being more truly in its
 own nature than in the divine mind, because it belongs to human
 nature to be material, which, as existing in the divine mind, it is
 not. Even so a house has nobler being in the architect's mind than in
 matter; yet a material house is called a house more truly than the
 one which exists in the mind; since the former is actual, the latter
 only potential.
"," Although bad things are in God's knowledge, as being
 comprised under that knowledge, yet they are not in God as created by
 Him, or preserved by Him, or as having their type in Him. They are
 known by God through the types of good things. Hence it cannot be
 said that bad things are life in God. Those things that are not in
 time may be called life in God in so far as life means understanding
 only, and inasmuch as they are understood by God; but not in so far
 as life implies a principle of operation.

114,"[I, Q. 19, Art. 1]
","Whether There Is Will in God?
"," It seems that there is not will in God. For the object of
 will is the end and the good. But we cannot assign to God any end.
 Therefore there is not will in God.
"," Further, will is a kind of appetite. But appetite, as it
 is directed to things not possessed, implies imperfection, which
 cannot be imputed to God. Therefore there is not will in God.
"," Further, according to the Philosopher (De Anima iii, 54),
 the will moves, and is moved. But God is the first cause of movement,
 and Himself is unmoved, as proved in Phys. viii, 49. Therefore there
 is not will in God.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Although nothing apart from God is His end, yet He
 Himself is the end with respect to all things made by Him. And this
 by His essence, for by His essence He is good, as shown above (Q. 6,
 A. 3): for the end has the aspect of good.
"," Will in us belongs to the appetitive part, which,
 although named from appetite, has not for its only act the seeking
 what it does not possess; but also the loving and the delighting in
 what it does possess. In this respect will is said to be in God, as
 having always good which is its object, since, as already said, it is
 not distinct from His essence.
"," A will of which the principal object is a good outside
 itself, must be moved by another; but the object of the divine will
 is His goodness, which is His essence. Hence, since the will of God
 is His essence, it is not moved by another than itself, but by itself
 alone, in the same sense as understanding and willing are said to be
 movement. This is what Plato meant when he said that the first mover
 moves itself.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
115,"[I, Q. 19, Art. 2]
","Whether God Wills Things Apart from Himself?
"," It seems that God does not will things apart from
 Himself. For the divine will is the divine existence. But God is not
 other than Himself. Therefore He does not will things other than
 Himself.
"," Further, the willed moves the willer, as the appetible the
 appetite, as stated in De Anima iii, 54. If, therefore, God wills
 anything apart from Himself, His will must be moved by another; which
 is impossible.
"," Further, if what is willed suffices the willer, he seeks
 nothing beyond it. But His own goodness suffices God, and completely
 satisfies His will. Therefore God does not will anything apart from
 Himself.
"," Further, acts of will are multiplied in proportion to the
 number of their objects. If, therefore, God wills Himself and things
 apart from Himself, it follows that the act of His will is manifold,
 and consequently His existence, which is His will. But this is
 impossible. Therefore God does not will things apart from Himself.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," The divine will is God's own existence essentially,
 yet they differ in aspect, according to the different ways of
 understanding them and expressing them, as is clear from what has
 already been said (Q. 13, A. 4). For when we say that God exists, no
 relation to any other object is implied, as we do imply when we say
 that God wills. Therefore, although He is not anything apart from
 Himself, yet He does will things apart from Himself.
"," In things willed for the sake of the end, the whole
 reason for our being moved is the end, and this it is that moves the
 will, as most clearly appears in things willed only for the sake of
 the end. He who wills to take a bitter draught, in doing so wills
 nothing else than health; and this alone moves his will. It is
 different with one who takes a draught that is pleasant, which anyone
 may will to do, not only for the sake of health, but also for its own
 sake. Hence, although God wills things apart from Himself only for
 the sake of the end, which is His own goodness, it does not follow
 that anything else moves His will, except His goodness. So, as He
 understands things apart from Himself by understanding His own
 essence, so He wills things apart from Himself by willing His own
 goodness.
"," From the fact that His own goodness suffices the divine
 will, it does not follow that it wills nothing apart from itself, but
 rather that it wills nothing except by reason of its goodness. Thus,
 too, the divine intellect, though its perfection consists in its very
 knowledge of the divine essence, yet in that essence knows other
 things.
"," As the divine intellect is one, as seeing the many only
 in the one, in the same way the divine will is one and simple, as
 willing the many only through the one, that is, through its own
 goodness.
",,,,,,,,,,,,
116,"[I, Q. 19, Art. 3]
","Whether Whatever God Wills He Wills Necessarily?
"," It seems that whatever God wills He wills necessarily.
 For everything eternal is necessary. But whatever God wills, He wills
 from eternity, for otherwise His will would be mutable. Therefore
 whatever He wills, He wills necessarily.
"," Further, God wills things apart from Himself, inasmuch as He
 wills His own goodness. Now God wills His own goodness necessarily.
 Therefore He wills things apart from Himself necessarily.
"," Further, whatever belongs to the nature of God is necessary,
 for God is of Himself necessary being, and the principle of all
 necessity, as above shown (Q. 2, A. 3). But it belongs to His nature
 to will whatever He wills; since in God there can be nothing over and
 above His nature as stated in Metaph. v, 6. Therefore whatever He
 wills, He wills necessarily.
"," Further, being that is not necessary, and being that is
 possible not to be, are one and the same thing. If, therefore, God
 does not necessarily will a thing that He wills, it is possible for
 Him not to will it, and therefore possible for Him to will what He
 does not will. And so the divine will is contingent upon one or the
 other of two things, and imperfect, since everything contingent is
 imperfect and mutable.
"," Further, on the part of that which is indifferent to one or
 the other of two things, no action results unless it is inclined to
 one or the other by some other power, as the Commentator [*Averroes]
 says in Phys. ii. If, then, the Will of God is indifferent with
 regard to anything, it follows that His determination to act comes
 from another; and thus He has some cause prior to Himself.
"," Further, whatever God knows, He knows necessarily. But as the
 divine knowledge is His essence, so is the divine will. Therefore
 whatever God wills, He wills necessarily.
",,,,,,,,,,,," From the fact that God wills from eternity whatever He
 wills, it does not follow that He wills it necessarily; except by
 supposition.
"," Although God necessarily wills His own goodness, He
 does not necessarily will things willed on account of His goodness;
 for it can exist without other things.
"," It is not natural to God to will any of those other
 things that He does not will necessarily; and yet it is not unnatural
 or contrary to His nature, but voluntary.
"," Sometimes a necessary cause has a non-necessary
 relation to an effect; owing to a deficiency in the effect, and not
 in the cause. Even so, the sun's power has a non-necessary relation
 to some contingent events on this earth, owing to a defect not in the
 solar power, but in the effect that proceeds not necessarily from the
 cause. In the same way, that God does not necessarily will some of
 the things that He wills, does not result from defect in the divine
 will, but from a defect belonging to the nature of the thing willed,
 namely, that the perfect goodness of God can be without it; and such
 defect accompanies all created good.
"," A naturally contingent cause must be determined to act
 by some external power. The divine will, which by its nature is
 necessary, determines itself to will things to which it has no
 necessary relation.
"," As the divine essence is necessary of itself, so is the
 divine will and the divine knowledge; but the divine knowledge has a
 necessary relation to the thing known; not the divine will to the
 thing willed. The reason for this is that knowledge is of things as
 they exist in the knower; but the will is directed to things as they
 exist in themselves. Since then all other things have necessary
 existence inasmuch as they exist in God; but no absolute necessity so
 as to be necessary in themselves, in so far as they exist in
 themselves; it follows that God knows necessarily whatever He wills,
 but does not will necessarily whatever He wills.
",,,,,,,,,,
117,"[I, Q. 19, Art. 4]
","Whether the Will of God Is the Cause of Things?
"," It seems that the will of God is not the cause of things.
 For Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv, 1): ""As our sun, not by reason nor
 by pre-election, but by its very being, enlightens all things that can
 participate in its light, so the divine good by its very essence pours
 the rays of goodness upon everything that exists."" But every voluntary
 agent acts by reason and pre-election. Therefore God does not act by
 will; and so His will is not the cause of things.
"," Further, The first in any order is that which is essentially
 so, thus in the order of burning things, that comes first which is
 fire by its essence. But God is the first agent. Therefore He acts by
 His essence; and that is His nature. He acts then by nature, and not
 by will. Therefore the divine will is not the cause of things.
"," Further, Whatever is the cause of anything, through being
 such a thing, is the cause by nature, and not by will. For fire is
 the cause of heat, as being itself hot; whereas an architect is the
 cause of a house, because he wills to build it. Now Augustine says (De
 Doctr. Christ. i, 32), ""Because God is good, we exist."" Therefore God
 is the cause of things by His nature, and not by His will.
"," Further, Of one thing there is one cause. But the [cause of]
 created things is the knowledge of God, as said before (Q. 14, A. 8).
 Therefore the will of God cannot be considered the cause of things.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," Dionysius in these words does not intend to exclude
 election from God absolutely; but only in a certain sense, in so far,
 that is, as He communicates His goodness not merely to certain
 things, but to all; and as election implies a certain distinction.
"," Because the essence of God is His intellect and will,
 from the fact of His acting by His essence, it follows that He acts
 after the mode of intellect and will.
"," Good is the object of the will. The words, therefore,
 ""Because God is good, we exist,"" are true inasmuch as His goodness is
 the reason of His willing all other things, as said before (A. 2, ad
 2).
"," Even in us the cause of one and the same effect is
 knowledge as directing it, whereby the form of the work is conceived,
 and will as commanding it, since the form as it is in the intellect
 only is not determined to exist or not to exist in the effect, except
 by the will. Hence, the speculative intellect has nothing to say to
 operation. But the power is cause, as executing the effect, since it
 denotes the immediate principle of operation. But in God all these
 things are one.
",,,,,,,,,,,,
118,"[I, Q. 19, Art. 5]
","Whether Any Cause Can Be Assigned to the Divine Will?
"," It seems that some cause can be assigned to the divine
 will. For Augustine says (Qq. lxxxiii, 46): ""Who would venture to say
 that God made all things irrationally?"" But to a voluntary agent, what
 is the reason of operating, is the cause of willing. Therefore the
 will of God has some cause.
"," Further, in things made by one who wills to make them, and
 whose will is influenced by no cause, there can be no cause assigned
 except by the will of him who wills. But the will of God is the cause
 of all things, as has been already shown (A. 4). If, then, there is
 no cause of His will, we cannot seek in any natural things any cause,
 except the divine will alone. Thus all science would be in vain,
 since science seeks to assign causes to effects. This seems
 inadmissible, and therefore we must assign some cause to the divine
 will.
"," Further, what is done by the willer, on account of no cause,
 depends simply on his will. If, therefore, the will of God has no
 cause, it follows that all things made depend simply on His will, and
 have no other cause. But this also is not admissible.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The will of God is reasonable, not because anything is
 to God a cause of willing, but in so far as He wills one thing to be
 on account of another.
"," Since God wills effects to proceed from definite
 causes, for the preservation of order in the universe, it is not
 unreasonable to seek for causes secondary to the divine will. It
 would, however, be unreasonable to do so, if such were considered as
 primary, and not as dependent on the will of God. In this sense
 Augustine says (De Trin. iii, 2): ""Philosophers in their vanity have
 thought fit to attribute contingent effects to other causes, being
 utterly unable to perceive the cause that is shown above all others,
 the will of God.""
"," Since God wills effects to come from causes, all
 effects that presuppose some other effect do not depend solely on the
 will of God, but on something else besides: but the first effect
 depends on the divine will alone. Thus, for example, we may say that
 God willed man to have hands to serve his intellect by their work,
 and intellect, that he might be man; and willed him to be man that he
 might enjoy Him, or for the completion of the universe. But this
 cannot be reduced to other created secondary ends. Hence such things
 depend on the simple will of God; but the others on the order of
 other causes.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
119,"[I, Q. 19, Art. 6]
","Whether the Will of God Is Always Fulfilled?
"," It seems that the will of God is not always fulfilled.
 For the Apostle says (1 Tim. 2:4): ""God will have all men to be saved,
 and to come to the knowledge of the truth."" But this does not happen.
 Therefore the will of God is not always fulfilled.
"," Further, as is the relation of knowledge to truth, so is that
 of the will to good. Now God knows all truth. Therefore He wills all
 good. But not all good actually exists; for much more good might
 exist. Therefore the will of God is not always fulfilled.
"," Further, since the will of God is the first cause, it does
 not exclude intermediate causes. But the effect of a first cause may
 be hindered by a defect of a secondary cause; as the effect of the
 motive power may be hindered by the weakness of the limb. Therefore
 the effect of the divine will may be hindered by a defect of the
 secondary causes. The will of God, therefore, is not always fulfilled.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The words of the Apostle, ""God will have all men to be
 saved,"" etc. can be understood in three ways. First, by a restricted
 application, in which case they would mean, as Augustine says (De
 praed. sanct. i, 8: Enchiridion 103), ""God wills all men to be saved
 that are saved, not because there is no man whom He does not wish
 saved, but because there is no man saved whose salvation He does not
 will."" Secondly, they can be understood as applying to every class of
 individuals, not to every individual of each class; in which case
 they mean that God wills some men of every class and condition to be
 saved, males and females, Jews and Gentiles, great and small, but not
 all of every condition. Thirdly, according to Damascene (De Fide
 Orth. ii, 29), they are understood of the antecedent will of God; not
 of the consequent will. This distinction must not be taken as
 applying to the divine will itself, in which there is nothing
 antecedent nor consequent, but to the things willed.
"," An act of the cognitive faculty is according as the
 thing known is in the knower; while an act of the appetite faculty is
 directed to things as they exist in themselves. But all that can have
 the nature of being and truth virtually exists in God, though it does
 not all exist in created things. Therefore God knows all truth; but
 does not will all good, except in so far as He wills Himself, in Whom
 all good virtually exists.
"," A first cause can be hindered in its effect by
 deficiency in the secondary cause, when it is not the universal first
 cause, including within itself all causes; for then the effect could
 in no way escape its order. And thus it is with the will of God, as
 said above.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
120,"[I, Q. 19, Art. 7]
","Whether the Will of God Is Changeable?
"," It seems that the will of God is changeable. For the Lord
 says (Gen. 6:7): ""It repenteth Me that I have made man."" But whoever
 repents of what he has done, has a changeable will. Therefore God has
 a changeable will.
"," Further, it is said in the person of the Lord: ""I will speak
 against a nation and against a kingdom, to root out, and to pull
 down, and to destroy it; but if that nation shall repent of its evil,
 I also will repent of the evil that I have thought to do to them""
 (Jer. 18:7, 8). Therefore God has a changeable will.
"," Further, whatever God does, He does voluntarily. But God does
 not always do the same thing, for at one time He ordered the law to
 be observed, and at another time forbade it. Therefore He has a
 changeable will.
"," Further, God does not will of necessity what He wills, as
 said before (A. 3). Therefore He can both will and not will the
 same thing. But whatever can incline to either of two opposites, is
 changeable substantially; and that which can exist in a place or not
 in that place, is changeable locally. Therefore God is changeable as
 regards His will.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," These words of the Lord are to be understood
 metaphorically, and according to the likeness of our nature. For when
 we repent, we destroy what we have made; although we may even do so
 without change of will; as, when a man wills to make a thing, at the
 same time intending to destroy it later. Therefore God is said to
 have repented, by way of comparison with our mode of acting, in so
 far as by the deluge He destroyed from the face of the earth man whom
 He had made.
"," The will of God, as it is the first and universal
 cause, does not exclude intermediate causes that have power to
 produce certain effects. Since however all intermediate causes are
 inferior in power to the first cause, there are many things in the
 divine power, knowledge and will that are not included in the order
 of inferior causes. Thus in the case of the raising of Lazarus, one
 who looked only on inferior causes might have said: ""Lazarus will not
 rise again,"" but looking at the divine first cause might have said:
 ""Lazarus will rise again."" And God wills both: that is, that in the
 order of the inferior cause a thing shall happen; but that in the
 order of the higher cause it shall not happen; or He may will
 conversely. We may say, then, that God sometimes declares that a
 thing shall happen according as it falls under the order of inferior
 causes, as of nature, or merit, which yet does not happen as not
 being in the designs of the divine and higher cause. Thus He foretold
 to Ezechias: ""Take order with thy house, for thou shalt die, and not
 live"" (Isa. 38:1). Yet this did not take place, since from eternity it
 was otherwise disposed in the divine knowledge and will, which is
 unchangeable. Hence Gregory says (Moral. xvi, 5): ""The sentence of
 God changes, but not His counsel""--that is to say, the counsel of His
 will. When therefore He says, ""I also will repent,"" His words must be
 understood metaphorically. For men seem to repent, when they do not
 fulfill what they have threatened.
"," It does not follow from this argument that God has a
 will that changes, but that He sometimes wills that things should
 change.
"," Although God's willing a thing is not by absolute
 necessity, yet it is necessary by supposition, on account of the
 unchangeableness of the divine will, as has been said above (A. 3).

121,"[I, Q. 19, Art. 8]
","Whether the Will of God Imposes Necessity on the Things Willed?
"," It seems that the will of God imposes necessity on the
 things willed. For Augustine says (Enchiridion 103): ""No one is saved,
 except whom God has willed to be saved. He must therefore be asked to
 will it; for if He wills it, it must necessarily be.""
"," Further, every cause that cannot be hindered, produces its
 effect necessarily, because, as the Philosopher says (Phys. ii, 84)
 ""Nature always works in the same way, if there is nothing to hinder
 it."" But the will of God cannot be hindered. For the Apostle says
 (Rom. 9:19): ""Who resisteth His will?"" Therefore the will of God
 imposes necessity on the things willed.
"," Further, whatever is necessary by its antecedent cause is
 necessary absolutely; it is thus necessary that animals should die,
 being compounded of contrary elements. Now things created by God are
 related to the divine will as to an antecedent cause, whereby they
 have necessity. For the conditional statement is true that if God
 wills a thing, it comes to pass; and every true conditional statement
 is necessary. It follows therefore that all that God wills is
 necessary absolutely.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," By the words of Augustine we must understand a
 necessity in things willed by God that is not absolute, but
 conditional. For the conditional statement that if God wills a
 thing it must necessarily be, is necessarily true.
"," From the very fact that nothing resists the divine
 will, it follows that not only those things happen that God wills
 to happen, but that they happen necessarily or contingently
 according to His will.
"," Consequents have necessity from their antecedents
 according to the mode of the antecedents. Hence things effected by
 the divine will have that kind of necessity that God wills them to
 have, either absolute or conditional. Not all things, therefore,
 are absolute necessities.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
122,"[I, Q. 19, Art. 8]
","Whether God Wills Evils?
"," It seems that God wills evils. For every good that
 exists, God wills. But it is a good that evil should exist. For
 Augustine says (Enchiridion 95): ""Although evil in so far as it is
 evil is not a good, yet it is good that not only good things should
 exist, but also evil things."" Therefore God wills evil things.
"," Further, Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv, 23): ""Evil would
 conduce to the perfection of everything,"" i.e. the universe. And
 Augustine says (Enchiridion 10, 11): ""Out of all things is built up
 the admirable beauty of the universe, wherein even that which is
 called evil, properly ordered and disposed, commends the good more
 evidently in that good is more pleasing and praiseworthy when
 contrasted with evil."" But God wills all that appertains to the
 perfection and beauty of the universe, for this is what God desires
 above all things in His creatures. Therefore God wills evil.
"," Further, that evil should exist, and should not exist, are
 contradictory opposites. But God does not will that evil should not
 exist; otherwise, since various evils do exist, God's will would not
 always be fulfilled. Therefore God wills that evil should exist.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Some have said that although God does not will evil,
 yet He wills that evil should be or be done, because, although evil
 is not a good, yet it is good that evil should be or be done. This
 they said because things evil in themselves are ordered to some good
 end; and this order they thought was expressed in the words ""that
 evil should be or be done."" This, however, is not correct; since evil
 is not of itself ordered to good, but accidentally. For it is beside
 the intention of the sinner, that any good should follow from his
 sin; as it was beside the intention of tyrants that the patience of
 the martyrs should shine forth from all their persecutions. It cannot
 therefore be said that such an ordering to good is implied in the
 statement that it is a good thing that evil should be or be done,
 since nothing is judged of by that which appertains to it
 accidentally, but by that which belongs to it essentially.
"," Evil does not operate towards the perfection and beauty
 of the universe, except accidentally, as said above (ad 1). Therefore
 Dionysius in saying that ""evil would conduce to the perfection of the
 universe,"" draws a conclusion by reduction to an absurdity.
"," The statements that evil exists, and that evil exists
 not, are opposed as contradictories; yet the statements that anyone
 wills evil to exist and that he wills it not to be, are not so
 opposed; since either is affirmative. God therefore neither wills
 evil to be done, nor wills it not to be done, but wills to permit
 evil to be done; and this is a good.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
123,"[I, Q. 19, Art. 10]
","Whether God Has Free-Will?
"," It seems that God has not free-will. For Jerome says, in
 a homily on the prodigal son [*Ep. 146, ad Damas.]; ""God alone is He
 who is not liable to sin, nor can be liable: all others, as having
 free-will, can be inclined to either side.""
"," Further, free-will is the faculty of the reason and will, by
 which good and evil are chosen. But God does not will evil, as has
 been said (A. 9). Therefore there is not free-will in God.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Jerome seems to deny free-will to God not simply, but
 only as regards the inclination to sin.
"," Since the evil of sin consists in turning away from the
 divine goodness, by which God wills all things, as above shown, it is
 manifestly impossible for Him to will the evil of sin; yet He can
 make choice of one of two opposites, inasmuch as He can will a thing
 to be, or not to be. In the same way we ourselves, without sin, can
 will to sit down, and not will to sit down.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
124,"[I, Q. 19, Art. 11]
","Whether the Will of Expression Is to Be Distinguished in God?
"," It seems that the will of expression is not to be
 distinguished in God. For as the will of God is the cause of things,
 so is His wisdom. But no expressions are assigned to the divine
 wisdom. Therefore no expressions ought to be assigned to the divine
 will.
"," Further, every expression that is not in agreement with the
 mind of him who expresses himself, is false. If therefore the
 expressions assigned to the divine will are not in agreement with
 that will, they are false. But if they do agree, they are
 superfluous. No expressions therefore must be assigned to the divine
 will.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Knowledge is not the cause of a thing being done,
 unless through the will. For we do not put into act what we know,
 unless we will to do so. Accordingly expression is not attributed to
 knowledge, but to will.
"," Expressions of will are called divine wills, not as
 being signs that God wills anything; but because what in us is the
 usual expression of our will, is called the divine will in God. Thus
 punishment is not a sign that there is anger in God; but it is called
 anger in Him, from the fact that it is an expression of anger in
 ourselves.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
125,"[I, Q. 19, Art. 12]
","Whether Five Expressions of Will Are Rightly Assigned to the Divine
"," It seems that five expressions of will--namely,
 prohibition, precept, counsel, operation, and permission--are not
 rightly assigned to the divine will. For the same things that God
 bids us do by His precept or counsel, these He sometimes operates in
 us, and the same things that He prohibits, these He sometimes
 permits. They ought not therefore to be enumerated as distinct.
"," Further, God works nothing unless He wills it, as the
 Scripture says (Wis. 11:26). But the will of expression is distinct
 from the will of good pleasure. Therefore operation ought not to be
 comprehended in the will of expression.
"," Further, operation and permission appertain to all creatures
 in common, since God works in them all, and permits some action in
 them all. But precept, counsel, and prohibition belong to rational
 creatures only. Therefore they do not come rightly under one
 division, not being of one order.
"," Further, evil happens in more ways than good, since ""good
 happens in one way, but evil in all kinds of ways,"" as declared by
 the Philosopher (Ethic. ii, 6), and Dionysius (Div. Nom. iv, 22). It
 is not right therefore to assign one expression only in the case of
 evil--namely, prohibition--and two--namely, counsel and precept--in
 the case of good.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," There is nothing to prevent anyone declaring his will
 about the same matter in different ways; thus we find many words that
 mean the same thing. Hence there is no reason why the same thing
 should not be the subject of precept, operation, and counsel; or of
 prohibition or permission.
"," As God may by metaphor be said to will what by His
 will, properly speaking, He wills not; so He may by metaphor be said
 to will what He does, properly speaking, will. Hence there is nothing
 to prevent the same thing being the object of the will of good
 pleasure, and of the will of expression. But operation is always the
 same as the will of good pleasure; while precept and counsel are not;
 both because the former regards the present, and the two latter the
 future; and because the former is of itself the effect of the will;
 the latter its effect as fulfilled by means of another.
"," Rational creatures are masters of their own acts; and
 for this reason certain special expressions of the divine will are
 assigned to their acts, inasmuch as God ordains rational creatures to
 act voluntarily and of themselves. Other creatures act only as moved
 by the divine operation; therefore only operation and permission are
 concerned with these.
"," All evil of sin, though happening in many ways, agrees
 in being out of harmony with the divine will. Hence with regard to
 evil, only one expression is assigned, that of prohibition. On the
 other hand, good stands in various relations to the divine goodness,
 since there are good deeds without which we cannot attain to the
 fruition of that goodness, and these are the subject of precept; and
 there are others by which we attain to it more perfectly, and these
 are the subject of counsel. Or it may be said that counsel is not
 only concerned with the obtaining of greater good; but also with the
 avoiding of lesser evils.
",,,,,,,,,,,,
126,"[I, Q. 20, Art. 1]
","Whether Love Exists in God?
"," It seems that love does not exist in God. For in God
 there are no passions. Now love is a passion. Therefore love is not
 in God.
"," Further, love, anger, sorrow and the like, are mutually
 divided against one another. But sorrow and anger are not attributed
 to God, unless by metaphor. Therefore neither is love attributed to
 Him.
"," Further, Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv): ""Love is a uniting
 and binding force."" But this cannot take place in God, since He is
 simple. Therefore love does not exist in God.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The cognitive faculty does not move except through the
 medium of the appetitive: and just as in ourselves the universal
 reason moves through the medium of the particular reason, as stated
 in De Anima iii, 58, 75, so in ourselves the intellectual appetite,
 or the will as it is called, moves through the medium of the
 sensitive appetite. Hence, in us the sensitive appetite is the
 proximate motive-force of our bodies. Some bodily change therefore
 always accompanies an act of the sensitive appetite, and this change
 affects especially the heart, which, as the Philosopher says (De
 part. animal. iii, 4), is the first principle of movement in animals.
 Therefore acts of the sensitive appetite, inasmuch as they have
 annexed to them some bodily change, are called passions; whereas acts
 of the will are not so called. Love, therefore, and joy and delight
 are passions; in so far as they denote acts of the intellective
 appetite, they are not passions. It is in this latter sense that they
 are in God. Hence the Philosopher says (Ethic. vii): ""God rejoices by
 an operation that is one and simple,"" and for the same reason He
 loves without passion.
"," In the passions of the sensitive appetite there may be
 distinguished a certain material element--namely, the bodily
 change--and a certain formal element, which is on the part of the
 appetite. Thus in anger, as the Philosopher says (De Anima iii, 15,
 63, 64), the material element is the kindling of the blood about the
 heart; but the formal, the appetite for revenge. Again, as regards
 the formal element of certain passions a certain imperfection is
 implied, as in desire, which is of the good we have not, and in
 sorrow, which is about the evil we have. This applies also to anger,
 which supposes sorrow. Certain other passions, however, as love and
 joy, imply no imperfection. Since therefore none of these can be
 attributed to God on their material side, as has been said (ad 1);
 neither can those that even on their formal side imply imperfection
 be attributed to Him; except metaphorically, and from likeness of
 effects, as already show (Q. 3, A. 2, ad 2; Q. 19, A. 11). Whereas,
 those that do not imply imperfection, such as love and joy, can be
 properly predicated of God, though without attributing passion to
 Him, as said before (Q. 19, A. 11).
"," An act of love always tends towards two things; to the
 good that one wills, and to the person for whom one wills it: since
 to love a person is to wish that person good. Hence, inasmuch as we
 love ourselves, we wish ourselves good; and, so far as possible,
 union with that good. So love is called the unitive force, even in
 God, yet without implying composition; for the good that He wills for
 Himself, is no other than Himself, Who is good by His essence, as
 above shown (Q. 6, AA. 1, 3). And by the fact that anyone loves
 another, he wills good to that other. Thus he puts the other, as it
 were, in the place of himself; and regards the good done to him as
 done to himself. So far love is a binding force, since it aggregates
 another to ourselves, and refers his good to our own. And then again
 the divine love is a binding force, inasmuch as God wills good to
 others; yet it implies no composition in God.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
127,"[I, Q. 20, Art. 2]
","Whether God Loves All Things?
"," It seems that God does not love all things. For
 according to Dionysius (Div. Nom. iv, 1), love places the lover
 outside himself, and causes him to pass, as it were, into the object
 of his love. But it is not admissible to say that God is placed
 outside of Himself, and passes into other things. Therefore it is
 inadmissible to say that God loves things other than Himself.
"," Further, the love of God is eternal. But things apart from
 God are not from eternity; except in God. Therefore God does not love
 anything, except as it exists in Himself. But as existing in Him, it
 is no other than Himself. Therefore God does not love things other
 than Himself.
"," Further, love is twofold--the love, namely, of desire, and
 the love of friendship. Now God does not love irrational creatures
 with the love of desire, since He needs no creature outside Himself.
 Nor with the love of friendship; since there can be no friendship
 with irrational creatures, as the Philosopher shows (Ethic. viii, 2).
 Therefore God does not love all things.
"," Further, it is written (Ps. 5:7): ""Thou hatest all the
 workers of iniquity."" Now nothing is at the same time hated and
 loved. Therefore God does not love all things.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," A lover is placed outside himself, and made to pass
 into the object of his love, inasmuch as he wills good to the
 beloved; and works for that good by his providence even as he works
 for his own. Hence Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv, 1): ""On behalf of
 the truth we must make bold to say even this, that He Himself, the
 cause of all things, by His abounding love and goodness, is placed
 outside Himself by His providence for all existing things.""
"," Although creatures have not existed from eternity,
 except in God, yet because they have been in Him from eternity, God
 has known them eternally in their proper natures; and for that reason
 has loved them, even as we, by the images of things within us, know
 things existing in themselves.
"," Friendship cannot exist except towards rational
 creatures, who are capable of returning love, and communicating one
 with another in the various works of life, and who may fare well or
 ill, according to the changes of fortune and happiness; even as to
 them is benevolence properly speaking exercised. But irrational
 creatures cannot attain to loving God, nor to any share in the
 intellectual and beatific life that He lives. Strictly speaking,
 therefore, God does not love irrational creatures with the love of
 friendship; but as it were with the love of desire, in so far as He
 orders them to rational creatures, and even to Himself. Yet this is
 not because He stands in need of them; but only on account of His
 goodness, and of the services they render to us. For we can desire a
 thing for others as well as for ourselves.
"," Nothing prevents one and the same thing being loved
 under one aspect, while it is hated under another. God loves sinners
 in so far as they are existing natures; for they have existence and
 have it from Him. In so far as they are sinners, they have not
 existence at all, but fall short of it; and this in them is not from
 God. Hence under this aspect, they are hated by Him.

128,"[I, Q. 20, Art. 3]
","Whether God Loves All Things Equally?
"," It seems that God loves all things equally. For it is
 said: ""He hath equally care of all"" (Wis. 6:8). But God's providence
 over things comes from the love wherewith He loves them. Therefore He
 loves all things equally.
"," Further, the love of God is His essence. But God's essence
 does not admit of degree; neither therefore does His love. He does
 not therefore love some things more than others.
"," Further, as God's love extends to created things, so do His
 knowledge and will extend. But God is not said to know some things
 more than others; nor will one thing more than another. Neither
 therefore does He love some things more than others.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," God is said to have equally care of all, not because by
 His care He deals out equal good to all, but because He administers
 all things with a like wisdom and goodness.
"," This argument is based on the intensity of love on the
 part of the act of the will, which is the divine essence. But the
 good that God wills for His creatures, is not the divine essence.
 Therefore there is no reason why it may not vary in degree.
"," To understand and to will denote the act alone, and do
 not include in their meaning objects from the diversity of which God
 may be said to know or will more or less, as has been said with
 respect to God's love.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
129,"[I, Q. 20, Art. 4]
","Whether God Always Loves More the Better Things?
"," It seems that God does not always love more the better
 things. For it is manifest that Christ is better than the whole human
 race, being God and man. But God loved the human race more than He
 loved Christ; for it is said: ""He spared not His own Son, but
 delivered Him up for us all"" (Rom. 8:32). Therefore God does not
 always love more the better things.
"," Further, an angel is better than a man. Hence it is said of
 man: ""Thou hast made him a little less than the angels"" (Ps. 8:6).
 But God loved men more than He loved the angels, for it is said:
 ""Nowhere doth He take hold of the angels, but of the seed of Abraham
 He taketh hold"" (Heb. 2:16). Therefore God does not always love more
 the better things.
"," Further, Peter was better than John, since he loved Christ
 more. Hence the Lord, knowing this to be true, asked Peter, saying:
 ""Simon, son of John, lovest thou Me more than these?"" Yet Christ
 loved John more than He loved Peter. For as Augustine says,
 commenting on the words, ""Simon, son of John, lovest thou Me?"": ""By
 this very mark is John distinguished from the other disciples, not
 that He loved him only, but that He loved him more than the rest.""
 Therefore God does not always love more the better things.
"," Further, the innocent man is better than the repentant, since
 repentance is, as Jerome says (Cap. 3 in Isa.), ""a second plank after
 shipwreck."" But God loves the penitent more than the innocent; since
 He rejoices over him the more. For it is said: ""I say to you that
 there shall be joy in heaven upon the one sinner that doth penance,
 more than upon ninety-nine just who need not penance"" (Luke 15:7).
 Therefore God does not always love more the better things.
"," Further, the just man who is foreknown is better than the
 predestined sinner. Now God loves more the predestined sinner, since
 He wills for him a greater good, life eternal. Therefore God does not
 always love more the better things.
",,,,,,,,,,,,," God loves Christ not only more than He loves the whole
 human race, but more than He loves the entire created universe:
 because He willed for Him the greater good in giving Him ""a name that
 is above all names,"" in so far as He was true God. Nor did anything
 of His excellence diminish when God delivered Him up to death for the
 salvation of the human race; rather did He become thereby a glorious
 conqueror: ""The government was placed upon His shoulder,"" according
 to Isa. 9:6.
"," God loves the human nature assumed by the Word of God
 in the person of Christ more than He loves all the angels; for that
 nature is better, especially on the ground of the union with the
 Godhead. But speaking of human nature in general, and comparing it
 with the angelic, the two are found equal, in the order of grace and
 of glory: since according to Rev 21:17, the measure of a man and of
 an angel is the same. Yet so that, in this respect, some angels are
 found nobler than some men, and some men nobler than some angels. But
 as to natural condition an angel is better than a man. God therefore
 did not assume human nature because He loved man, absolutely
 speaking, more; but because the needs of man were greater; just as
 the master of a house may give some costly delicacy to a sick
 servant, that he does not give to his own son in sound health.
"," This doubt concerning Peter and John has been solved in
 various ways. Augustine interprets it mystically, and says that the
 active life, signified by Peter, loves God more than the
 contemplative signified by John, because the former is more conscious
 of the miseries of this present life, and therefore the more ardently
 desires to be freed from them, and depart to God. God, he says, loves
 more the contemplative life, since He preserves it longer. For it
 does not end, as the active life does, with the life of the body.
"," The penitent and the innocent are related as exceeding
 and exceeded. For whether innocent or penitent, those are the better
 and better loved who have most grace. Other things being equal,
 innocence is the nobler thing and the more beloved. God is said to
 rejoice more over the penitent than over the innocent, because often
 penitents rise from sin more cautious, humble, and fervent. Hence
 Gregory commenting on these words (Hom. 34 in Ev.) says that, ""In
 battle the general loves the soldier who after flight returns and
 bravely pursues the enemy, more than him who has never fled, but has
 never done a brave deed.""
"," Since God's will is the cause of goodness in things,
 the goodness of one who is loved by God is to be reckoned according
 to the time when some good is to be given to him by divine goodness.
 According therefore to the time, when there is to be given by the
 divine will to the predestined sinner a greater good, the sinner is
 better; although according to some other time he is the worse;
 because even according to some time he is neither good nor bad.

","Whether There Is Justice in God?
"," It seems that there is not justice in God. For justice is
 divided against temperance. But temperance does not exist in God:
 neither therefore does justice.
"," Further, he who does whatsoever he wills and pleases does
 not work according to justice. But, as the Apostle says: ""God worketh
 all things according to the counsel of His will"" (Eph. 1:11).
 Therefore justice cannot be attributed to Him.
"," Further, the act of justice is to pay what is due. But
 God is no man's debtor. Therefore justice does not belong to God.
"," Further, whatever is in God, is His essence. But justice
 cannot belong to this. For Boethius says (De Hebdom.): ""Good regards
 the essence; justice the act."" Therefore justice does not belong to
 God.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," Certain of the moral virtues are concerned with the
 passions, as temperance with concupiscence, fortitude with fear and
 daring, meekness with anger. Such virtues as these can only
 metaphorically be attributed to God; since, as stated above (Q. 20,
 A. 1), in God there are no passions; nor a sensitive appetite, which
 is, as the Philosopher says (Ethic. iii, 10), the subject of those
 virtues. On the other hand, certain moral virtues are concerned with
 works of giving and expending; such as justice, liberality, and
 magnificence; and these reside not in the sensitive faculty, but in
 the will. Hence, there is nothing to prevent our attributing these
 virtues to God; although not in civil matters, but in such acts as
 are not unbecoming to Him. For, as the Philosopher says (Ethic. x,
 8), it would be absurd to praise God for His political virtues.
"," Since good as perceived by intellect is the object of
 the will, it is impossible for God to will anything but what His
 wisdom approves. This is, as it were, His law of justice, in
 accordance with which His will is right and just. Hence, what He does
 according to His will He does justly: as we do justly what we do
 according to law. But whereas law comes to us from some higher power,
 God is a law unto Himself.
"," To each one is due what is his own. Now that which is
 directed to a man is said to be his own. Thus the master owns the
 servant, and not conversely, for that is free which is its own cause.
 In the word debt, therefore, is implied a certain exigence or
 necessity of the thing to which it is directed. Now a twofold order
 has to be considered in things: the one, whereby one created thing is
 directed to another, as the parts of the whole, accident to
 substance, and all things whatsoever to their end; the other, whereby
 all created things are ordered to God. Thus in the divine operations
 debt may be regarded in two ways, as due either to God, or to
 creatures, and in either way God pays what is due. It is due to God
 that there should be fulfilled in creatures what His will and wisdom
 require, and what manifests His goodness. In this respect, God's
 justice regards what befits Him; inasmuch as He renders to Himself
 what is due to Himself. It is also due to a created thing that it
 should possess what is ordered to it; thus it is due to man to have
 hands, and that other animals should serve him. Thus also God
 exercises justice, when He gives to each thing what is due to it by
 its nature and condition. This debt however is derived from the
 former; since what is due to each thing is due to it as ordered to it
 according to the divine wisdom. And although God in this way pays
 each thing its due, yet He Himself is not the debtor, since He is not
 directed to other things, but rather other things to Him. Justice,
 therefore, in God is sometimes spoken of as the fitting accompaniment
 of His goodness; sometimes as the reward of merit. Anselm touches on
 either view where he says (Prosolog. 10): ""When Thou dost punish the
 wicked, it is just, since it agrees with their deserts; and when Thou
 dost spare the wicked, it is also just; since it befits Thy goodness.""
"," Although justice regards act, this does not prevent its
 being the essence of God; since even that which is of the essence of
 a thing may be the principle of action. But good does not always
 regard act; since a thing is called good not merely with respect to
 act, but also as regards perfection in its essence. For this reason
 it is said (De Hebdom.) that the good is related to the just, as the
 general to the special.
",,,,,,,,,,,,
131,"[I, Q. 21, Art. 2]
","Whether the Justice of God Is Truth?
"," It seems that the justice of God is not truth. For
 justice resides in the will; since, as Anselm says (Dial. Verit. 13),
 it is a rectitude of the will, whereas truth resides in the intellect,
 as the Philosopher says (Metaph. vi; Ethic. vi, 2,6). Therefore
 justice does not appertain to truth.
"," Further, according to the Philosopher (Ethic. iv, 7),
 truth is a virtue distinct from justice. Truth therefore does not
 appertain to the idea of justice.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Justice, as to the law that governs, resides in the
 reason or intellect; but as to the command whereby our actions are
 governed according to the law, it resides in the will.
"," The truth of which the Philosopher is speaking in this
 passage, is that virtue whereby a man shows himself in word and deed
 such as he really is. Thus it consists in the conformity of the sign
 with the thing signified; and not in that of the effect with its
 cause and rule: as has been said regarding the truth of justice.

","Whether Mercy Can Be Attributed to God?
"," It seems that mercy cannot be attributed to God. For
 mercy is a kind of sorrow, as Damascene says (De Fide Orth. ii, 14).
 But there is no sorrow in God; and therefore there is no mercy in Him.
"," Further, mercy is a relaxation of justice. But God cannot
 remit what appertains to His justice. For it is said (2 Tim. 2:13):
 ""If we believe not, He continueth faithful: He cannot deny Himself.""
 But He would deny Himself, as a gloss says, if He should deny His
 words. Therefore mercy is not becoming to God.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,," This argument is based on mercy, regarded as an
 affection of passion.
"," God acts mercifully, not indeed by going against His
 justice, but by doing something more than justice; thus a man who
 pays another two hundred pieces of money, though owing him only one
 hundred, does nothing against justice, but acts liberally or
 mercifully. The case is the same with one who pardons an offence
 committed against him, for in remitting it he may be said to bestow a
 gift. Hence the Apostle calls remission a forgiving: ""Forgive one
 another, as Christ has forgiven you"" (Eph. 4:32). Hence it is clear
 that mercy does not destroy justice, but in a sense is the fulness
 thereof. And thus it is said: ""Mercy exalteth itself above judgement""
 (James 2:13).
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
133,"[I, Q. 21, Art. 4]
","Whether in Every Work of God There Are Mercy and Justice?
"," It seems that not in every work of God are mercy and
 justice. For some works of God are attributed to mercy, as the
 justification of the ungodly; and others to justice, as the damnation
 of the wicked. Hence it is said: ""Judgment without mercy to him that
 hath not done mercy"" (James 2:13). Therefore not in every work of God
 do mercy and justice appear.
"," Further, the Apostle attributes the conversion of the Jews to
 justice and truth, but that of the Gentiles to mercy (Rom. 15).
 Therefore not in every work of God are justice and mercy.
"," Further, many just persons are afflicted in this world; which
 is unjust. Therefore not in every work of God are justice and mercy.
"," Further, it is the part of justice to pay what is due, but of
 mercy to relieve misery. Thus both justice and mercy presuppose
 something in their works: whereas creation presupposes nothing.
 Therefore in creation neither mercy nor justice is found.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," Certain works are attributed to justice, and certain
 others to mercy, because in some justice appears more forcibly and in
 others mercy. Even in the damnation of the reprobate mercy is seen,
 which, though it does not totally remit, yet somewhat alleviates, in
 punishing short of what is deserved.
"," God's justice and mercy appear both in the conversion
 of the Jews and of the Gentiles. But an aspect of justice appears in
 the conversion of the Jews which is not seen in the conversion of the
 Gentiles; inasmuch as the Jews were saved on account of the promises
 made to the fathers.
"," Justice and mercy appear in the punishment of the just
 in this world, since by afflictions lesser faults are cleansed in
 them, and they are the more raised up from earthly affections to God.
 As to this Gregory says (Moral. xxvi, 9): ""The evils that press on us
 in this world force us to go to God.""
"," Although creation presupposes nothing in the universe;
 yet it does presuppose something in the knowledge of God. In this way
 too the idea of justice is preserved in creation; by the production
 of beings in a manner that accords with the divine wisdom and
 goodness. And the idea of mercy, also, is preserved in the change of
 creatures from non-existence to existence.

134,"[I, Q. 22, Art. 1]
","Whether Providence Can Suitably Be Attributed to God?
"," It seems that providence is not becoming to God. For
 providence, according to Tully (De Invent. ii), is a part of
 prudence. But prudence, since, according to the Philosopher (Ethic.
 vi, 5, 9, 18), it gives good counsel, cannot belong to God, Who never
 has any doubt for which He should take counsel. Therefore providence
 cannot belong to God.
"," Further, whatever is in God, is eternal. But providence is
 not anything eternal, for it is concerned with existing things that
 are not eternal, according to Damascene (De Fide Orth. ii, 29).
 Therefore there is no providence in God.
"," Further, there is nothing composite in God. But providence
 seems to be something composite, because it includes both the
 intellect and the will. Therefore providence is not in God.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," According to the Philosopher (Ethic. vi, 9, 10),
 ""Prudence is what, strictly speaking, commands all that 'ebulia' has
 rightly counselled and 'synesis' rightly judged"" [*Cf. I-II, Q. 57,
 A. 6]. Whence, though to take counsel may not be fitting to God, from
 the fact that counsel is an inquiry into matters that are doubtful,
 nevertheless to give a command as to the ordering of things towards
 an end, the right reason of which He possesses, does belong to God,
 according to Ps. 148:6: ""He hath made a decree, and it shall not pass
 away."" In this manner both prudence and providence belong to God.
 Although at the same time it may be said that the very reason of
 things to be done is called counsel in God; not because of any
 inquiry necessitated, but from the certitude of the knowledge, to
 which those who take counsel come by inquiry. Whence it is said: ""Who
 worketh all things according to the counsel of His will"" (Eph. 1:11).
"," Two things pertain to the care of providence--namely,
 the ""reason of order,"" which is called providence and disposition;
 and the execution of order, which is termed government. Of these, the
 first is eternal, and the second is temporal.
"," Providence resides in the intellect; but presupposes
 the act of willing the end. Nobody gives a precept about things done
 for an end; unless he will that end. Hence prudence presupposes the
 moral virtues, by means of which the appetitive faculty is directed
 towards good, as the Philosopher says. Even if Providence has to do
 with the divine will and intellect equally, this would not affect the
 divine simplicity, since in God both the will and intellect are one
 and the same thing, as we have said above (Q. 19).
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
135,"[I, Q. 22, Art. 2]
","Whether Everything Is Subject to the Providence of God?
"," It seems that everything is not subject to divine
 providence. For nothing foreseen can happen by chance. If then
 everything was foreseen by God, nothing would happen by chance. And
 thus hazard and luck would disappear; which is against common opinion.
"," Further, a wise provider excludes any defect or evil, as far
 as he can, from those over whom he has a care. But we see many evils
 existing. Either, then, God cannot hinder these, and thus is not
 omnipotent; or else He does not have care for everything.
"," Further, whatever happens of necessity does not require
 providence or prudence. Hence, according to the Philosopher (Ethic.
 vi, 5, 9, 10, 11): ""Prudence is the right reason of things contingent
 concerning which there is counsel and choice."" Since, then, many
 things happen from necessity, everything cannot be subject to
 providence.
"," Further, whatsoever is left to itself cannot be subject to
 the providence of a governor. But men are left to themselves by God
 in accordance with the words: ""God made man from the beginning, and
 left him in the hand of his own counsel"" (Ecclus. 15:14). And
 particularly in reference to the wicked: ""I let them go according to
 the desires of their heart"" (Ps. 80:13). Everything, therefore,
 cannot be subject to divine providence.
"," Further, the Apostle says (1 Cor. 9:9): ""God doth not care
 for oxen [*Vulg. 'Doth God take care for oxen?']"": and we may say the
 same of other irrational creatures. Thus everything cannot be under
 the care of divine providence.
",,,,,,,,,,,,," There is a difference between universal and particular
 causes. A thing can escape the order of a particular cause; but not
 the order of a universal cause. For nothing escapes the order of a
 particular cause, except through the intervention and hindrance of
 some other particular cause; as, for instance, wood may be prevented
 from burning, by the action of water. Since then, all particular
 causes are included under the universal cause, it could not be that
 any effect should take place outside the range of that universal
 cause. So far then as an effect escapes the order of a particular
 cause, it is said to be casual or fortuitous in respect to that
 cause; but if we regard the universal cause, outside whose range no
 effect can happen, it is said to be foreseen. Thus, for instance, the
 meeting of two servants, although to them it appears a chance
 circumstance, has been fully foreseen by their master, who has
 purposely sent them to meet at the one place, in such a way that the
 one knows not about the other.
"," It is otherwise with one who has care of a particular
 thing, and one whose providence is universal, because a particular
 provider excludes all defects from what is subject to his care as far
 as he can; whereas, one who provides universally allows some little
 defect to remain, lest the good of the whole should be hindered.
 Hence, corruption and defects in natural things are said to be
 contrary to some particular nature; yet they are in keeping with the
 plan of universal nature; inasmuch as the defect in one thing yields
 to the good of another, or even to the universal good: for the
 corruption of one is the generation of another, and through this it
 is that a species is kept in existence. Since God, then, provides
 universally for all being, it belongs to His providence to permit
 certain defects in particular effects, that the perfect good of the
 universe may not be hindered, for if all evil were prevented, much
 good would be absent from the universe. A lion would cease to live,
 if there were no slaying of animals; and there would be no patience
 of martyrs if there were no tyrannical persecution. Thus Augustine
 says (Enchiridion 2): ""Almighty God would in no wise permit evil to
 exist in His works, unless He were so almighty and so good as to
 produce good even from evil."" It would appear that it was on account
 of these two arguments to which we have just replied, that some were
 persuaded to consider corruptible things--e.g. casual and evil
 things--as removed from the care of divine providence.
"," Man is not the author of nature; but he uses natural
 things in applying art and virtue to his own use. Hence human
 providence does not reach to that which takes place in nature from
 necessity; but divine providence extends thus far, since God is the
 author of nature. Apparently it was this argument that moved those
 who withdrew the course of nature from the care of divine providence,
 attributing it rather to the necessity of matter, as Democritus, and
 others of the ancients.
"," When it is said that God left man to himself, this does
 not mean that man is exempt from divine providence; but merely that
 he has not a prefixed operating force determined to only the one
 effect; as in the case of natural things, which are only acted upon
 as though directed by another towards an end; and do not act of
 themselves, as if they directed themselves towards an end, like
 rational creatures, through the possession of free will, by which
 these are able to take counsel and make a choice. Hence it is
 significantly said: ""In the hand of his own counsel."" But since the
 very act of free will is traced to God as to a cause, it necessarily
 follows that everything happening from the exercise of free will must
 be subject to divine providence. For human providence is included
 under the providence of God, as a particular under a universal cause.
 God, however, extends His providence over the just in a certain more
 excellent way than over the wicked; inasmuch as He prevents anything
 happening which would impede their final salvation. For ""to them that
 love God, all things work together unto good"" (Rom. 8:28). But from
 the fact that He does not restrain the wicked from the evil of sin,
 He is said to abandon them: not that He altogether withdraws His
 providence from them; otherwise they would return to nothing, if they
 were not preserved in existence by His providence. This was the
 reason that had weight with Tully, who withdrew from the care of
 divine providence human affairs concerning which we take counsel.
"," Since a rational creature has, through its free will,
 control over its actions, as was said above (Q. 19, A. 10), it is
 subject to divine providence in an especial manner, so that something
 is imputed to it as a fault, or as a merit; and there is given it
 accordingly something by way of punishment or reward. In this way,
 the Apostle withdraws oxen from the care of God: not, however, that
 individual irrational creatures escape the care of divine providence;
 as was the opinion of the Rabbi Moses.

136,"[I, Q. 22, Art. 3]
","Whether God Has Immediate Providence Over Everything?
"," It seems that God has not immediate providence over all
 things. For whatever is contained in the notion of dignity, must be
 attributed to God. But it belongs to the dignity of a king, that he
 should have ministers; through whose mediation he provides for his
 subjects. Therefore much less has God Himself immediate providence
 over all things.
"," Further, it belongs to providence to order all things to an
 end. Now the end of everything is its perfection and its good. But it
 appertains to every cause to direct its effect to good; wherefore
 every active cause is a cause of the effect of providence. If
 therefore God were to have immediate providence over all things, all
 secondary causes would be withdrawn.
"," Further, Augustine says (Enchiridion 17) that, ""It is better
 to be ignorant of some things than to know them, for example, vile
 things"": and the Philosopher says the same (Metaph. xii, 51). But
 whatever is better must be assigned to God. Therefore He has not
 immediate providence over bad and vile things.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," It pertains to a king's dignity to have ministers who
 execute his providence. But the fact that he has not the plan of
 those things which are done by them arises from a deficiency in
 himself. For every operative science is the more perfect, the more it
 considers the particular things with which its action is concerned.
"," God's immediate provision over everything does not
 exclude the action of secondary causes; which are the executors of
 His order, as was said above (Q. 19, AA. 5, 8).
"," It is better for us not to know low and vile things,
 because by them we are impeded in our knowledge of what is better and
 higher; for we cannot understand many things simultaneously; because
 the thought of evil sometimes perverts the will towards evil. This
 does not hold with God, Who sees everything simultaneously at one
 glance, and whose will cannot turn in the direction of evil.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
137,"[I, Q. 22, Art. 4]
","Whether Providence Imposes Any Necessity on Things Foreseen?
"," It seems that divine providence imposes necessity upon
 things foreseen. For every effect that has a per se cause, either
 present or past, which it necessarily follows, happens from necessity;
 as the Philosopher proves (Metaph. vi, 7). But the providence of God,
 since it is eternal, pre-exists; and the effect flows from it of
 necessity, for divine providence cannot be frustrated. Therefore
 divine providence imposes a necessity upon things foreseen.
"," Further, every provider makes his work as stable as he
 can, lest it should fail. But God is most powerful. Therefore He
 assigns the stability of necessity to things provided.
"," Further, Boethius says (De Consol. iv, 6): ""Fate from the
 immutable source of providence binds together human acts and fortunes
 by the indissoluble connection of causes."" It seems therefore that
 providence imposes necessity upon things foreseen.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The effect of divine providence is not only that
 things should happen somehow; but that they should happen either by
 necessity or by contingency. Therefore whatsoever divine providence
 ordains to happen infallibly and of necessity happens infallibly and
 of necessity; and that happens from contingency, which the plan of
 divine providence conceives to happen from contingency.
"," The order of divine providence is unchangeable and
 certain, so far as all things foreseen happen as they have been
 foreseen, whether from necessity or from contingency.
"," That indissolubility and unchangeableness of
 which Boethius speaks, pertain to the certainty of providence, which
 fails not to produce its effect, and that in the way foreseen; but
 they do not pertain to the necessity of the effects. We must remember
 that properly speaking ""necessary"" and ""contingent"" are consequent
 upon being, as such. Hence the mode both of necessity and of
 contingency falls under the foresight of God, who provides universally
 for all being; not under the foresight of causes that provide only for
 some particular order of things.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
138,"[I, Q. 23, Art. 1]
","Whether Men Are Predestined by God?
"," It seems that men are not predestined by God, for
 Damascene says (De Fide Orth. ii, 30): ""It must be borne in mind that
 God foreknows but does not predetermine everything, since He foreknows
 all that is in us, but does not predetermine it all."" But human merit
 and demerit are in us, forasmuch as we are the masters of our own acts
 by free will. All that pertains therefore to merit or demerit is not
 predestined by God; and thus man's predestination is done away.
"," Further, all creatures are directed to their end by divine
 providence, as was said above (Q. 22, AA. 1, 2). But other creatures
 are not said to be predestined by God. Therefore neither are men.
"," Further, the angels are capable of beatitude, as well as men.
 But predestination is not suitable to angels, since in them there
 never was any unhappiness (miseria); for predestination, as Augustine
 says (De praedest. sanct. 17), is the ""purpose to take pity
 [miserendi]"" [*See Q. 22, A. 3]. Therefore men are not predestined.
"," Further, the benefits God confers upon men are revealed by
 the Holy Ghost to holy men according to the saying of the Apostle (1
 Cor. 2:12): ""Now we have received not the spirit of this world, but
 the Spirit that is of God: that we may know the things that are given
 us from God."" Therefore if man were predestined by God, since
 predestination is a benefit from God, his predestination would be
 made known to each predestined; which is clearly false.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," Damascene calls predestination an imposition of
 necessity, after the manner of natural things which are predetermined
 towards one end. This is clear from his adding: ""He does not will
 malice, nor does He compel virtue."" Whence predestination is not
 excluded by Him.
"," Irrational creatures are not capable of that end which
 exceeds the faculty of human nature. Whence they cannot be properly
 said to be predestined; although improperly the term is used in
 respect of any other end.
"," Predestination applies to angels, just as it does to
 men, although they have never been unhappy. For movement does not
 take its species from the term wherefrom but from the term
 whereto. Because it matters nothing, in respect of the notion of
 making white, whether he who is made white was before black, yellow
 or red. Likewise it matters nothing in respect of the notion of
 predestination whether one is predestined to life eternal from the
 state of misery or not. Although it may be said that every conferring
 of good above that which is due pertains to mercy; as was shown
 previously (Q. 21, AA. 3, 4).
"," Even if by a special privilege their predestination
 were revealed to some, it is not fitting that it should be revealed
 to everyone; because, if so, those who were not predestined would
 despair; and security would beget negligence in the predestined.
",,,,,,,,,,,,
139,"[I, Q. 23, Art. 2]
","Whether Predestination Places Anything in the Predestined?
"," It seems that predestination does place something in the
 predestined. For every action of itself causes passion. If therefore
 predestination is action in God, predestination must be passion in the
 predestined.
"," Further, Origen says on the text, ""He who was predestined,""
 etc. (Rom. 1:4): ""Predestination is of one who is not; destination,
 of one who is."" And Augustine says (De Praed. Sanct.): ""What is
 predestination but the destination of one who is?"" Therefore
 predestination is only of one who actually exists; and it thus places
 something in the predestined.
"," Further, preparation is something in the thing prepared. But
 predestination is the preparation of God's benefits, as Augustine
 says (De Praed. Sanct. ii, 14). Therefore predestination is something
 in the predestined.
"," Further, nothing temporal enters into the definition of
 eternity. But grace, which is something temporal, is found in the
 definition of predestination. For predestination is the preparation
 of grace in the present; and of glory in the future. Therefore
 predestination is not anything eternal. So it must needs be that it is
 in the predestined, and not in God; for whatever is in Him is eternal.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," Actions passing out to external matter imply of
 themselves passion--for example, the actions of warming and cutting;
 but not so actions remaining in the agent, as understanding and
 willing, as said above (Q. 14, A. 2; Q. 18, A. 3, ad 1).
 Predestination is an action of this latter class. Wherefore, it does
 not put anything in the predestined. But its execution, which passes
 out to external things, has an effect in them.
"," Destination sometimes denotes a real mission of someone
 to a given end; thus, destination can only be said of someone
 actually existing. It is taken, however, in another sense for a
 mission which a person conceives in the mind; and in this manner we
 are said to destine a thing which we firmly propose in our mind. In
 this latter way it is said that Eleazar ""determined not to do any
 unlawful things for the love of life"" (2 Macc. 6:20). Thus
 destination can be of a thing which does not exist. Predestination,
 however, by reason of the antecedent nature it implies, can be
 attributed to a thing which does not actually exist; in whatsoever
 way destination is accepted.
"," Preparation is twofold: of the patient in respect to
 passion and this is in the thing prepared; and of the agent to
 action, and this is in the agent. Such a preparation is
 predestination, and as an agent by intellect is said to prepare
 itself to act, accordingly as it preconceives the idea of what is to
 be done. Thus, God from all eternity prepared by predestination,
 conceiving the idea of the order of some towards salvation.
"," Grace does not come into the definition of
 predestination, as something belonging to its essence, but inasmuch
 as predestination implies a relation to grace, as of cause to effect,
 and of act to its object. Whence it does not follow that
 predestination is anything temporal.
",,,,,,,,,,,,
140,"[I, Q. 23, Art. 3]
","Whether God Reprobates Any Man?
"," It seems that God reprobates no man. For nobody
 reprobates what he loves. But God loves every man, according to (Wis.
 11:25): ""Thou lovest all things that are, and Thou hatest none of the
 things Thou hast made."" Therefore God reprobates no man.
"," Further, if God reprobates any man, it would be necessary for
 reprobation to have the same relation to the reprobates as
 predestination has to the predestined. But predestination is the
 cause of the salvation of the predestined. Therefore reprobation will
 likewise be the cause of the loss of the reprobate. But this false.
 For it is said (Osee 13:9): ""Destruction is thy own, O Israel; Thy
 help is only in Me."" God does not, then, reprobate any man.
"," Further, to no one ought anything be imputed which he cannot
 avoid. But if God reprobates anyone, that one must perish. For it is
 said (Eccles. 7:14): ""Consider the works of God, that no man can
 correct whom He hath despised."" Therefore it could not be imputed to
 any man, were he to perish. But this is false. Therefore God does not
 reprobate anyone.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," God loves all men and all creatures, inasmuch as He
 wishes them all some good; but He does not wish every good to them
 all. So far, therefore, as He does not wish this particular
 good--namely, eternal life--He is said to hate or reprobated them.
"," Reprobation differs in its causality from
 predestination. This latter is the cause both of what is expected in
 the future life by the predestined--namely, glory--and of what is
 received in this life--namely, grace. Reprobation, however, is not
 the cause of what is in the present--namely, sin; but it is the cause
 of abandonment by God. It is the cause, however, of what is assigned
 in the future--namely, eternal punishment. But guilt proceeds from
 the free-will of the person who is reprobated and deserted by grace.
 In this way, the word of the prophet is true--namely, ""Destruction is
 thy own, O Israel.""
"," Reprobation by God does not take anything away from the
 power of the person reprobated. Hence, when it is said that the
 reprobated cannot obtain grace, this must not be understood as
 implying absolute impossibility: but only conditional impossibility:
 as was said above (Q. 19, A. 3), that the predestined must
 necessarily be saved; yet a conditional necessity, which does not do
 away with the liberty of choice. Whence, although anyone reprobated
 by God cannot acquire grace, nevertheless that he falls into this or
 that particular sin comes from the use of his free-will. Hence it is
 rightly imputed to him as guilt.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
141,"[I, Q. 23, Art. 4]
","Whether the Predestined Are Chosen by God? [*""Eligantur.""]
"," It seems that the predestined are not chosen by God. For
 Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv, 1) that as the corporeal sun sends his
 rays upon all without selection, so does God His goodness. But the
 goodness of God is communicated to some in an especial manner through
 a participation of grace and glory. Therefore God without any
 selection communicates His grace and glory; and this belongs to
 predestination.
"," Further, election is of things that exist. But predestination
 from all eternity is also of things which do not exist. Therefore,
 some are predestined without election.
"," Further, election implies some discrimination. Now God ""wills
 all men to be saved"" (1 Tim. 2:4). Therefore, predestination which
 ordains men towards eternal salvation, is without election.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," If the communication of the divine goodness in general
 be considered, God communicates His goodness without election;
 inasmuch as there is nothing which does not in some way share in His
 goodness, as we said above (Q. 6, A. 4). But if we consider the
 communication of this or that particular good, He does not allot it
 without election; since He gives certain goods to some men, which He
 does not give to others. Thus in the conferring of grace and glory
 election is implied.
"," When the will of the person choosing is incited to make
 a choice by the good already pre-existing in the object chosen, the
 choice must needs be of those things which already exist, as happens
 in our choice. In God it is otherwise; as was said above (Q. 20, A.
 2). Thus, as Augustine says (De Verb. Ap. Serm. 11): ""Those are
 chosen by God, who do not exist; yet He does not err in His choice.""
"," God wills all men to be saved by His antecedent will,
 which is to will not simply but relatively; and not by His consequent
 will, which is to will simply.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
142,"[I, Q. 23, Art. 5]
","Whether the Foreknowledge of Merits Is the Cause of Predestination?
"," It seems that foreknowledge of merits is the cause of
 predestination. For the Apostle says (Rom. 8:29): ""Whom He foreknew,
 He also predestined."" Again a gloss of Ambrose on Rom. 9:15: ""I will
 have mercy upon whom I will have mercy"" says: ""I will give mercy to
 him who, I foresee, will turn to Me with his whole heart."" Therefore
 it seems the foreknowledge of merits is the cause of predestination.
"," Further, Divine predestination includes the divine will,
 which by no means can be irrational; since predestination is ""the
 purpose to have mercy,"" as Augustine says (De Praed. Sanct. ii, 17).
 But there can be no other reason for predestination than the
 foreknowledge of merits. Therefore it must be the cause of reason of
 predestination.
"," Further, ""There is no injustice in God"" (Rom. 9:14). Now
 it would seem unjust that unequal things be given to equals. But all
 men are equal as regards both nature and original sin; and inequality
 in them arises from the merits or demerits of their actions. Therefore
 God does not prepare unequal things for men by predestinating and
 reprobating, unless through the foreknowledge of their merits and
 demerits.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The use of grace foreknown by God is not the cause of
 conferring grace, except after the manner of a final cause; as was
 explained above.
"," Predestination has its foundation in the goodness of
 God as regards its effects in general. Considered in its particular
 effects, however, one effect is the reason of another; as already
 stated.
"," The reason for the predestination of some, and
 reprobation of others, must be sought for in the goodness of God. Thus
 He is said to have made all things through His goodness, so that the
 divine goodness might be represented in things. Now it is necessary
 that God's goodness, which in itself is one and undivided, should be
 manifested in many ways in His creation; because creatures in
 themselves cannot attain to the simplicity of God. Thus it is that for
 the completion of the universe there are required different grades of
 being; some of which hold a high and some a low place in the universe.
 That this multiformity of grades may be preserved in things, God
 allows some evils, lest many good things should never happen, as was
 said above (Q. 22, A. 2). Let us then consider the whole of the
 human race, as we consider the whole universe. God wills to manifest
 His goodness in men; in respect to those whom He predestines, by means
 of His mercy, as sparing them; and in respect of others, whom he
 reprobates, by means of His justice, in punishing them. This is the
 reason why God elects some and rejects others. To this the Apostle
 refers, saying (Rom. 9:22, 23): ""What if God, willing to show His wrath
 [that is, the vengeance of His justice], and to make His power known,
 endured [that is, permitted] with much patience vessels of wrath,
 fitted for destruction; that He might show the riches of His glory on
 the vessels of mercy, which He hath prepared unto glory"" and (2 Tim.
 2:20): ""But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and
 silver; but also of wood and of earth; and some, indeed, unto honor,
 but some unto dishonor."" Yet why He chooses some for glory, and
 reprobates others, has no reason, except the divine will. Whence
 Augustine says (Tract. xxvi. in Joan.): ""Why He draws one, and another
 He draws not, seek not to judge, if thou dost not wish to err."" Thus
 too, in the things of nature, a reason can be assigned, since primary
 matter is altogether uniform, why one part of it was fashioned by God
 from the beginning under the form of fire, another under the form of
 earth, that there might be a diversity of species in things of nature.
 Yet why this particular part of matter is under this particular form,
 and that under another, depends upon the simple will of God; as from
 the simple will of the artificer it depends that this stone is in part
 of the wall, and that in another; although the plan requires that some
 stones should be in this place, and some in that place. Neither on
 this account can there be said to be injustice in God, if He prepares
 unequal lots for not unequal things. This would be altogether contrary
 to the notion of justice, if the effect of predestination were granted
 as a debt, and not gratuitously. In things which are given
 gratuitously, a person can give more or less, just as he pleases
 (provided he deprives nobody of his due), without any infringement of
 justice. This is what the master of the house said: ""Take what is
 thine, and go thy way. Is it not lawful for me to do what I will?""
 (Matt. 20:14,15).

143,"[I, Q. 23, Art. 6]
","Whether Predestination Is Certain?
"," It seems that predestination is not certain. Because
 on the words ""Hold fast that which thou hast, that no one take thy
 crown,"" (Rev 3:11), Augustine says (De Corr. et Grat. 15): ""Another
 will not receive, unless this one were to lose it."" Hence the crown
 which is the effect of predestination can be both acquired and lost.
 Therefore predestination cannot be certain.
"," Further, granted what is possible, nothing impossible
 follows. But it is possible that one predestined--e.g. Peter--may
 sin and then be killed. But if this were so, it would follow that
 the effect of predestination would be thwarted. This then, is not
 impossible. Therefore predestination is not certain.
"," Further, whatever God could do in the past, He can do
 now. But He could have not predestined whom He hath predestined.
 Therefore now He is able not to predestine him. Therefore
 predestination is not certain.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The crown may be said to belong to a person in two
 ways; first, by God's predestination, and thus no one loses his
 crown: secondly, by the merit of grace; for what we merit, in a
 certain way is ours; and thus anyone may lose his crown by mortal
 sin. Another person receives that crown thus lost, inasmuch as he
 takes the former's place. For God does not permit some to fall,
 without raising others; according to Job 34:24: ""He shall break in
 pieces many and innumerable, and make others to stand in their
 stead."" Thus men are substituted in the place of the fallen angels;
 and the Gentiles in that of the Jews. He who is substituted for
 another in the state of grace, also receives the crown of the fallen
 in that in eternal life he will rejoice at the good the other has
 done, in which life he will rejoice at all good whether done by
 himself or by others.
"," Although it is possible for one who is predestinated
 considered in himself to die in mortal sin; yet it is not possible,
 supposed, as in fact it is supposed. that he is predestinated. Whence
 it does not follow that predestination can fall short of its effect.
"," Since predestination includes the divine will as stated
 above (A. 4): and the fact that God wills any created thing is
 necessary on the supposition that He so wills, on account of the
 immutability of the divine will, but is not necessary absolutely; so
 the same must be said of predestination. Wherefore one ought not to
 say that God is able not to predestinate one whom He has
 predestinated, taking it in a composite sense, thought, absolutely
 speaking, God can predestinate or not. But in this way the certainty
 of predestination is not destroyed.

144,"[I, Q. 23, Art. 7]
","Whether the Number of the Predestined Is Certain?
"," It seems that the number of the predestined is not
 certain. For a number to which an addition can be made is not certain.
 But there can be an addition to the number of the predestined as it
 seems; for it is written (Deut. 1:11): ""The Lord God adds to this number
 many thousands,"" and a gloss adds, ""fixed by God, who knows those who
 belong to Him."" Therefore the number of the predestined is not
 certain.
"," Further, no reason can be assigned why God pre-ordains to
 salvation one number of men more than another. But nothing is arranged
 by God without a reason. Therefore the number to be saved pre-ordained
 by God cannot be certain.
"," Further, the operations of God are more perfect than those of
 nature. But in the works of nature, good is found in the majority of
 things; defect and evil in the minority. If, then, the number of the
 saved were fixed by God at a certain figure, there would be more
 saved than lost. Yet the contrary follows from Matt. 7:13,14: ""For
 wide is the gate, and broad the way that leadeth to destruction, and
 many there are who go in thereat. How narrow is the gate, and strait
 is the way that leadeth to life; and few there are who find it!""
 Therefore the number of those pre-ordained by God to be saved is not
 certain.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," These words of Deuteronomy must be taken as applied to
 those who are marked out by God beforehand in respect to present
 righteousness. For their number is increased and diminished, but not
 the number of the predestined.
"," The reason of the quantity of any one part must be
 judged from the proportion of that part of the whole. Thus in God the
 reason why He has made so many stars, or so many species of things,
 or predestined so many, is according to the proportion of the
 principal parts to the good of the whole universe.
"," The good that is proportionate to the common state of
 nature is to be found in the majority; and is wanting in the
 minority. The good that exceeds the common state of nature is to be
 found in the minority, and is wanting in the majority. Thus it is
 clear that the majority of men have a sufficient knowledge for the
 guidance of life; and those who have not this knowledge are said to
 be half-witted or foolish; but they who attain to a profound
 knowledge of things intelligible are a very small minority in respect
 to the rest. Since their eternal happiness, consisting in the vision
 of God, exceeds the common state of nature, and especially in so far
 as this is deprived of grace through the corruption of original sin,
 those who are saved are in the minority. In this especially, however,
 appears the mercy of God, that He has chosen some for that salvation,
 from which very many in accordance with the common course and
 tendency of nature fall short.

","Whether Predestination Can Be Furthered by the Prayers of the Saints?
"," It seems that predestination cannot be furthered by the
 prayers of the saints. For nothing eternal can be preceded by anything
 temporal; and in consequence nothing temporal can help towards making
 something else eternal. But predestination is eternal. Therefore,
 since the prayers of the saints are temporal, they cannot so help as
 to cause anyone to become predestined. Predestination therefore is not
 furthered by the prayers of the saints.
"," Further, as there is no need of advice except on account of
 defective knowledge, so there is no need of help except through
 defective power. But neither of these things can be said of God when
 He predestines. Whence it is said: ""Who hath helped the Spirit of the
 Lord? [*Vulg.: 'Who hath known the mind of the Lord?'] Or who hath
 been His counsellor?"" (Rom. 11:34). Therefore predestination cannot
 be furthered by the prayers of the saints.
"," Further, if a thing can be helped, it can also be hindered.
 But predestination cannot be hindered by anything. Therefore it
 cannot be furthered by anything.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," This argument shows that predestination is not
 furthered by the prayers of the saints, as regards the preordination.
"," One is said to be helped by another in two ways; in one
 way, inasmuch as he receives power from him: and to be helped thus
 belongs to the weak; but this cannot be said of God, and thus we are
 to understand, ""Who hath helped the Spirit of the Lord?"" In another
 way one is said to be helped by a person through whom he carries out
 his work, as a master through a servant. In this way God is helped by
 us; inasmuch as we execute His orders, according to 1 Cor. 3:9: ""We
 are God's co-adjutors."" Nor is this on account of any defect in the
 power of God, but because He employs intermediary causes, in order
 that the beauty of order may be preserved in the universe; and also
 that He may communicate to creatures the dignity of causality.
"," Secondary causes cannot escape the order of the first
 universal cause, as has been said above (Q. 19, A. 6), indeed, they
 execute that order. And therefore predestination can be furthered by
 creatures, but it cannot be impeded by them.

146,"[I, Q. 24, Art. 1]
","Whether the Book of Life Is the Same As Predestination?
"," It seems that the book of life is not the same thing as
 predestination. For it is said, ""All things are the book of life""
 (Ecclus. 4:32)--i.e. the Old and New Testament according to a gloss.
 This, however, is not predestination. Therefore the book of life is
 not predestination.
"," Further, Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xx, 14) that ""the book
 of life is a certain divine energy, by which it happens that to each
 one his good or evil works are recalled to memory."" But divine energy
 belongs seemingly, not to predestination, but rather to divine power.
 Therefore the book of life is not the same thing as predestination.
"," Further, reprobation is opposed to predestination. So, if the
 book of life were the same as predestination, there should also be a
 book of death, as there is a book of life.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The book of life may be understood in two senses. In
 one sense as the inscription of those who are chosen to life; thus we
 now speak of the book of life. In another sense the inscription of
 those things which lead us to life may be called the book of life;
 and this also is twofold, either as of things to be done; and thus
 the Old and New Testament are called a book of life; or of things
 already done, and thus that divine energy by which it happens that to
 each one his deeds will be recalled to memory, is spoken of as the
 book of life. Thus that also may be called the book of war, whether
 it contains the names inscribed of those chosen for military service;
 or treats of the art of warfare, or relates the deeds of soldiers.
"," It is the custom to inscribe, not those who are
 rejected, but those who are chosen. Whence there is no book of death
 corresponding to reprobation; as the book of life to predestination.
"," Predestination and the book of life are different
 aspects of the same thing. For this latter implies the knowledge of
 predestination; as also is made clear from the gloss quoted above.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
147,"[I, Q. 24, Art. 2]
","Whether the Book of Life Regards Only the Life of Glory of the
"," It seems that the book of life does not only regard
 the life of glory of the predestined. For the book of life is the
 knowledge of life. But God, through His own life, knows all other
 life. Therefore the book of life is so called in regard to divine
 life; and not only in regard to the life of the predestined.
"," Further, as the life of glory comes from God, so also does
 the life of nature. Therefore, if the knowledge of the life of glory
 is called the book of life; so also should the knowledge of the life
 of nature be so called.
"," Further, some are chosen to the life of grace who are not
 chosen to the life of glory; as it is clear from what is said: ""Have
 not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?"" (John 6:71). But
 the book of life is the inscription of the divine election, as stated
 above (A. 1). Therefore it applies also to the life of grace.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The divine life, even considered as a life of glory, is
 natural to God; whence in His regard there is no election, and in
 consequence no book of life: for we do not say that anyone is chosen
 to possess the power of sense, or any of those things that are
 consequent on nature.
"," The life of grace has the aspect, not of an end, but of
 something directed towards an end. Hence nobody is said to be chosen
 to the life of grace, except so far as the life of grace is directed
 to glory. For this reason those who, possessing grace, fail to obtain
 glory, are not said to be chosen simply, but relatively. Likewise
 they are not said to be written in the book of life simply, but
 relatively; that is to say, that it is in the ordination and
 knowledge of God that they are to have some relation to eternal life,
 according to their participation in grace.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
148,"[I, Q. 24, Art. 3]
","Whether Anyone May Be Blotted Out of the Book of Life?
"," It seems that no one may be blotted out of the book of
 life. For Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xx, 15): ""God's foreknowledge,
 which cannot be deceived, is the book of life."" But nothing can be
 taken away from the foreknowledge of God, nor from predestination.
 Therefore neither can anyone be blotted out from the book of life.
"," Further, whatever is in a thing is in it according to the
 disposition of that thing. But the book of life is something eternal
 and immutable. Therefore whatsoever is written therein, is there not
 in a temporary way, but immovably, and indelibly.
"," Further, blotting out is the contrary to inscription. But
 nobody can be written a second time in the book of life. Neither
 therefore can he be blotted out.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The act of blotting out does not refer to the book of
 life as regards God's foreknowledge, as if in God there were any
 change; but as regards things foreknown, which can change.
"," Although things are immutably in God, yet in themselves
 they are subject to change. To this it is that the blotting out of
 the book of life refers.
"," The way in which one is said to be blotted out of the
 book of life is that in which one is said to be written therein anew;
 either in the opinion of men, or because he begins again to have
 relation towards eternal life through grace; which also is included
 in the knowledge of God, although not anew.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
149,"[I, Q. 25, Art. 1]
","Whether There Is Power in God?
"," It seems that power is not in God. For as primary matter
 is to power, so God, who is the first agent, is to act. But primary
 matter, considered in itself, is devoid of all act. Therefore, the
 first agent--namely, God--is devoid of power.
"," Further, according to the Philosopher (Metaph. vi, 19),
 better than every power is its act. For form is better than matter;
 and action than active power, since it is its end. But nothing is
 better than what is in God; because whatsoever is in God, is God, as
 was shown above (Q. 3, A. 3). Therefore, there is no power in
 God.
"," Further, Power is the principle of operation. But the divine
 power is God's essence, since there is nothing accidental in God: and
 of the essence of God there is no principle. Therefore there is no
 power in God.
"," Further, it was shown above (Q. 14, A. 8; Q. 19, A. 4) that
 God's knowledge and will are the cause of things. But the cause and
 principle of a thing are identical. We ought not, therefore, to
 assign power to God; but only knowledge and will.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," Active power is not contrary to act, but is founded
 upon it, for everything acts according as it is actual: but passive
 power is contrary to act; for a thing is passive according as it is
 potential. Whence this potentiality is not in God, but only active
 power.
"," Whenever act is distinct from power, act must be nobler
 than power. But God's action is not distinct from His power, for both
 are His divine essence; neither is His existence distinct from His
 essence. Hence it does not follow that there should be anything in
 God nobler than His power.
"," In creatures, power is the principle not only of
 action, but likewise of effect. Thus in God the idea of power is
 retained, inasmuch as it is the principle of an effect; not, however,
 as it is a principle of action, for this is the divine essence
 itself; except, perchance, after our manner of understanding,
 inasmuch as the divine essence, which pre-contains in itself all
 perfection that exists in created things, can be understood either
 under the notion of action, or under that of power; as also it is
 understood under the notion of suppositum possessing nature, and
 under that of nature. Accordingly the notion of power is retained in
 God in so far as it is the principle of an effect.
"," Power is predicated of God not as something really
 distinct from His knowledge and will, but as differing from them
 logically; inasmuch as power implies a notion of a principle putting
 into execution what the will commands, and what knowledge directs,
 which three things in God are identified. Or we may say, that the
 knowledge or will of God, according as it is the effective principle,
 has the notion of power contained in it. Hence the consideration of
 the knowledge and will of God precedes the consideration of His
 power, as the cause precedes the operation and effect.
",,,,,,,,,,,,
150,"[I, Q. 25, Art. 2]
","Whether the Power of God Is Infinite?
"," It seems that the power of God is not infinite. For
 everything that is infinite is imperfect according to the Philosopher
 (Phys. iii, 6). But the power of God is far from imperfect. Therefore
 it is not infinite.
"," Further, every power is made known by its effect; otherwise
 it would be ineffectual. If, then, the power of God were infinite, it
 could produce an infinite effect, but this is impossible.
"," Further, the Philosopher proves (Phys. viii, 79) that if the
 power of any corporeal thing were infinite, it would cause
 instantaneous movement. God, however, does not cause instantaneous
 movement, but moves the spiritual creature in time, and the corporeal
 creature in place and time, as Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. 20, 22,
 23). Therefore, His power is not infinite.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The Philosopher is here speaking of an infinity in
 regard to matter not limited by any form; and such infinity belongs
 to quantity. But the divine essence is otherwise, as was shown above
 (Q. 7, A. 1); and consequently so also His power. It does not follow,
 therefore, that it is imperfect.
"," The power of a univocal agent is wholly manifested in
 its effect. The generative power of man, for example, is not able to
 do more than beget man. But the power of a non-univocal agent does
 not wholly manifest itself in the production of its effect: as, for
 example, the power of the sun does not wholly manifest itself in the
 production of an animal generated from putrefaction. Now it is clear
 that God is not a univocal agent. For nothing agrees with Him either
 in species or in genus, as was shown above (Q. 3, A. 5; Q. 4, A. 3).
 Whence it follows that His effect is always less than His power. It
 is not necessary, therefore, that the infinite power of God should be
 manifested so as to produce an infinite effect. Yet even if it were
 to produce no effect, the power of God would not be ineffectual;
 because a thing is ineffectual which is ordained towards an end to
 which it does not attain. But the power of God is not ordered toward
 its effect as towards an end; rather, it is the end of the effect
 produced by it.
"," The Philosopher (Phys. viii, 79) proves that if a body
 had infinite power, it would cause a non-temporal movement. And he
 shows that the power of the mover of heaven is infinite, because it
 can move in an infinite time. It remains, therefore, according to his
 reckoning, that the infinite power of a body, if such existed, would
 move without time; not, however, the power of an incorporeal mover.
 The reason of this is that one body moving another is a univocal
 agent; wherefore it follows that the whole power of the agent is made
 known in its motion. Since then the greater the power of a moving
 body, the more quickly does it move; the necessary conclusion is that
 if its power were infinite, it would move beyond comparison faster,
 and this is to move without time. An incorporeal mover, however, is
 not a univocal agent; whence it is not necessary that the whole of
 its power should be manifested in motion, so as to move without time;
 and especially since it moves in accordance with the disposition of
 its will.

151,"[I, Q. 25, Art. 3]
","Whether God Is Omnipotent?
"," It seems that God is not omnipotent. For movement and
 passiveness belong to everything. But this is impossible with God,
 for He is immovable, as was said above (Q. 2, A. 3). Therefore He
 is not omnipotent.
"," Further, sin is an act of some kind. But God cannot sin,
 nor ""deny Himself"" as it is said in 2 Tim. 2:13. Therefore He is
 not omnipotent.
"," Further, it is said of God that He manifests His omnipotence
 ""especially by sparing and having mercy"" [*Collect, 10th Sunday after
 Pentecost]. Therefore the greatest act possible to the divine power
 is to spare and have mercy. There are things much greater, however,
 than sparing and having mercy; for example, to create another world,
 and the like. Therefore God is not omnipotent.
"," Further, upon the text, ""God hath made foolish the wisdom of
 this world"" (1 Cor. 1:20), a gloss says: ""God hath made the wisdom of
 this world foolish [*Vulg.: 'Hath not God', etc.] by showing those
 things to be possible which it judges to be impossible."" Whence it
 would seem that nothing is to be judged possible or impossible in
 reference to inferior causes, as the wisdom of this world judges
 them; but in reference to the divine power. If God, then, were
 omnipotent, all things would be possible; nothing, therefore
 impossible. But if we take away the impossible, then we destroy also
 the necessary; for what necessarily exists is impossible not to
 exist. Therefore there would be nothing at all that is necessary in
 things if God were omnipotent. But this is an impossibility.
 Therefore God is not omnipotent.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," God is said to be omnipotent in respect to His active
 power, not to passive power, as was shown above (A. 1). Whence the
 fact that He is immovable or impassible is not repugnant to His
 omnipotence.
"," To sin is to fall short of a perfect action; hence to
 be able to sin is to be able to fall short in action, which is
 repugnant to omnipotence. Therefore it is that God cannot sin,
 because of His omnipotence. Nevertheless, the Philosopher says
 (Topic. iv, 3) that God can deliberately do what is evil. But this
 must be understood either on a condition, the antecedent of which is
 impossible--as, for instance, if we were to say that God can do evil
 things if He will. For there is no reason why a conditional
 proposition should not be true, though both the antecedent and
 consequent are impossible: as if one were to say: ""If man is a
 donkey, he has four feet."" Or he may be understood to mean that God
 can do some things which now seem to be evil: which, however, if He
 did them, would then be good. Or he is, perhaps, speaking after the
 common manner of the heathen, who thought that men became gods, like
 Jupiter or Mercury.
"," God's omnipotence is particularly shown in sparing and
 having mercy, because in this is it made manifest that God has
 supreme power, that He freely forgives sins. For it is not for one
 who is bound by laws of a superior to forgive sins of his own free
 will. Or, because by sparing and having mercy upon men, He leads them
 on to the participation of an infinite good; which is the ultimate
 effect of the divine power. Or because, as was said above (Q. 21, A.
 4), the effect of the divine mercy is the foundation of all the
 divine works. For nothing is due to anyone, except on account of
 something already given him gratuitously by God. In this way the
 divine omnipotence is particularly made manifest, because to it
 pertains the first foundation of all good things.
"," The absolute possible is not so called in reference
 either to higher causes, or to inferior causes, but in reference to
 itself. But the possible in reference to some power is named possible
 in reference to its proximate cause. Hence those things which it
 belongs to God alone to do immediately--as, for example, to create,
 to justify, and the like--are said to be possible in reference to a
 higher cause. Those things, however, which are of such kind as to be
 done by inferior causes are said to be possible in reference to those
 inferior causes. For it is according to the condition of the
 proximate cause that the effect has contingency or necessity, as was
 shown above (Q. 14, A. 1, ad 2). Thus is it that the wisdom of the
 world is deemed foolish, because what is impossible to nature, it
 judges to be impossible to God. So it is clear that the omnipotence
 of God does not take away from things their impossibility and
 necessity.

","Whether God Can Make the Past Not to Have Been?
"," It seems that God can make the past not to have been.
 For what is impossible in itself is much more impossible than that
 which is only impossible accidentally. But God can do what is
 impossible in itself, as to give sight to the blind, or to raise the
 dead. Therefore, and much more can He do what is only impossible
 accidentally. Now for the past not to have been is impossible
 accidentally: thus for Socrates not to be running is accidentally
 impossible, from the fact that his running is a thing of the past.
 Therefore God can make the past not to have been.
"," Further, what God could do, He can do now, since His power is
 not lessened. But God could have effected, before Socrates ran, that
 he should not run. Therefore, when he has run, God could effect that
 he did not run.
"," Further, charity is a more excellent virtue than virginity.
 But God can supply charity that is lost; therefore also lost
 virginity. Therefore He can so effect that what was corrupt should
 not have been corrupt.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Although it is impossible accidentally for the past not
 to have been, if one considers the past thing itself, as, for
 instance, the running of Socrates; nevertheless, if the past thing is
 considered as past, that it should not have been is impossible, not
 only in itself, but absolutely since it implies a contradiction.
 Thus, it is more impossible than the raising of the dead; in which
 there is nothing contradictory, because this is reckoned impossible
 in reference to some power, that is to say, some natural power; for
 such impossible things do come beneath the scope of divine power.
"," As God, in accordance with the perfection of the divine
 power, can do all things, and yet some things are not subject to His
 power, because they fall short of being possible; so, also, if we
 regard the immutability of the divine power, whatever God could do,
 He can do now. Some things, however, at one time were in the nature
 of possibility, whilst they were yet to be done, which now fall short
 of the nature of possibility, when they have been done. So is God
 said not to be able to do them, because they themselves cannot be
 done.
"," God can remove all corruption of the mind and body from
 a woman who has fallen; but the fact that she had been corrupt cannot
 be removed from her; as also is it impossible that the fact of having
 sinned or having lost charity thereby can be removed from the sinner.

","Whether God Can Do What He Does Not?
"," It seems that God cannot do other than what He does. For
 God cannot do what He has not foreknown and pre-ordained that He would
 do. But He neither foreknew nor pre-ordained that He would do anything
 except what He does. Therefore He cannot do except what He does.
"," Further, God can only do what ought to be done and what is
 right to be done. But God is not bound to do what He does not; nor is
 it right that He should do what He does not. Therefore He cannot do
 except what He does.
"," Further, God cannot do anything that is not good and
 befitting creation. But it is not good for creatures nor befitting
 them to be otherwise than as they are. Therefore God cannot do except
 what He does.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," In ourselves, in whom power and essence are distinct
 from will and intellect, and again intellect from wisdom, and will
 from justice, there can be something in the power which is not in the
 just will nor in the wise intellect. But in God, power and essence,
 will and intellect, wisdom and justice, are one and the same. Whence,
 there can be nothing in the divine power which cannot also be in His
 just will or in His wise intellect. Nevertheless, because His will
 cannot be determined from necessity to this or that order of things,
 except upon supposition, as was said above (Q. 19, A. 3), neither are
 the wisdom and justice of God restricted to this present order, as
 was shown above; so nothing prevents there being something in the
 divine power which He does not will, and which is not included in the
 order which He has place in things. Again, because power is
 considered as executing, the will as commanding, and the intellect
 and wisdom as directing; what is attributed to His power considered
 in itself, God is said to be able to do in accordance with His
 absolute power. Of such a kind is everything which has the nature of
 being, as was said above (A. 3). What is, however, attributed to the
 divine power, according as it carries into execution the command of a
 just will, God is said to be able to do by His ordinary power. In
 this manner, we must say that God can do other things by His absolute
 power than those He has foreknown and pre-ordained He would do. But
 it could not happen that He should do anything which He had not
 foreknown, and had not pre-ordained that He would do, because His
 actual doing is subject to His foreknowledge and pre-ordination,
 though His power, which is His nature, is not so. For God does things
 because He wills so to do; yet the power to do them does not come
 from His will, but from His nature.
"," God is bound to nobody but Himself. Hence, when it is
 said that God can only do what He ought, nothing else is meant by
 this than that God can do nothing but what is befitting to Himself,
 and just. But these words ""befitting"" and ""just"" may be understood in
 two ways: one, in direct connection with the verb ""is""; and thus they
 would be restricted to the present order of things; and would concern
 His power. Then what is said in the objection is false; for the sense
 is that God can do nothing except what is now fitting and just. If,
 however, they be joined directly with the verb ""can"" (which has the
 effect of extending the meaning), and then secondly with ""is,"" the
 present will be signified, but in a confused and general way. The
 sentence would then be true in this sense: ""God cannot do anything
 except that which, if He did it, would be suitable and just.""
"," Although this order of things be restricted to what now
 exists, the divine power and wisdom are not thus restricted. Whence,
 although no other order would be suitable and good to the things
 which now are, yet God can do other things and impose upon them
 another order.

 been envious."" For the same reason, if God could have made better
 things than He has done, but was not willing so to do, He would have
 been envious. But envy is far removed from God. Therefore God makes
 everything of the best. He cannot therefore make anything better
 than He does.
"," Further, what is very good and the best of all cannot be
 bettered; because nothing is better than the best. But as Augustine
 says (Enchiridion 10), ""each thing that God has made is good, and,
 taken all together they are very good; because in them all consists
 the wondrous beauty of the universe."" Therefore the good in the
 universe could not be made better by God.
"," Further, Christ as man is full of grace and truth, and has
 the Spirit without measure; and so He cannot be better. Again created
 happiness is described as the highest good, and thus cannot be
 better. And the Blessed Virgin Mary is raised above all the choirs of
 angels, and so cannot be better than she is. God cannot therefore
 make all things better than He has made them.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," When it is said that God can make a thing better than
 He makes it, if ""better"" is taken substantively, this proposition is
 true. For He can always make something else better than each
 individual thing: and He can make the same thing in one way better
 than it is, and in another way not; as was explained above. If,
 however, ""better"" is taken as an adverb, implying the manner of the
 making; thus God cannot make anything better than He makes it,
 because He cannot make it from greater wisdom and goodness. But if it
 implies the manner of the thing done, He can make something better;
 because He can give to things made by Him a better manner of
 existence as regards the accidents, although not as regards the
 substance.
"," It is of the nature of a son that he should be equal to
 his father, when he comes to maturity. But it is not of the nature of
 anything created, that it should be better than it was made by God.
 Hence the comparison fails.
"," The universe, the present creation being supposed,
 cannot be better, on account of the most beautiful order given to
 things by God; in which the good of the universe consists. For if any
 one thing were bettered, the proportion of order would be destroyed;
 as if one string were stretched more than it ought to be, the melody
 of the harp would be destroyed. Yet God could make other things, or
 add something to the present creation; and then there would be
 another and a better universe.
"," The humanity of Christ, from the fact that it is united
 to the Godhead; and created happiness from the fact that it is the
 fruition of God; and the Blessed Virgin from the fact that she is the
 mother of God; have all a certain infinite dignity from the infinite
 good, which is God. And on this account there cannot be anything
 better than these; just as there cannot be anything better than God.

155,"[I, Q. 26, Art. 1]
","Whether Beatitude Belongs to God?
"," It seems that beatitude does not belong to God. For
 beatitude according to Boethius (De Consol. iv) ""is a state made
 perfect by the aggregation of all good things."" But the aggregation of
 goods has no place in God; nor has composition. Therefore beatitude
 does not belong to God.
"," Further, beatitude or happiness is the reward of virtue,
 according to the Philosopher (Ethic. i, 9). But reward does not apply
 to God; as neither does merit. Therefore neither does beatitude.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Aggregation of good is in God, after the manner not of
 composition, but of simplicity; for those things which in creatures
 is manifold, pre-exist in God, as was said above (Q. 4, A. 2; Q. 13,
 A. 4), in simplicity and unity.
"," It belongs as an accident to beatitude or happiness to
 be the reward of virtue, so far as anyone attains to beatitude; even
 as to be the term of generation belongs accidentally to a being, so
 far as it passes from potentiality to act. As, then, God has being,
 though not begotten; so He has beatitude, although not acquired by
 merit.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
156,"[I, Q. 26, Art. 2]
","Whether God Is Called Blessed in Respect of His Intellect?
"," It seems that God is not called blessed in respect to
 His intellect. For beatitude is the highest good. But good is said to
 be in God in regard to His essence, because good has reference to
 being which is according to essence, according to Boethius (De
 Hebdom.). Therefore beatitude also is said to be in God in regard to
 His essence, and not to His intellect.
"," Further, Beatitude implies the notion of end. Now the end is
 the object of the will, as also is the good. Therefore beatitude is
 said to be in God with reference to His will, and not with reference
 to His intellect.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,," This argument proves that beatitude belongs to God; not
 that beatitude pertains essentially to Him under the aspect of His
 essence; but rather under the aspect of His intellect.
"," Since beatitude is a good, it is the object of the
 will; now the object is understood as prior to the act of a power.
 Whence in our manner of understanding, divine beatitude precedes the
 act of the will at rest in it. This cannot be other than the act of
 the intellect; and thus beatitude is to be found in an act of the
 intellect.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
157,"[I, Q. 26, Art. 3]
","Whether God Is the Beatitude of Each of the Blessed?
"," It seems that God is the beatitude of each of the
 blessed. For God is the supreme good, as was said above (Q. 6, AA. 2,
 4). But it is quite impossible that there should be many supreme
 goods, as also is clear from what has been said above (Q. 11, A. 3).
 Therefore, since it is of the essence of beatitude that it should be
 the supreme good, it seems that beatitude is nothing else but God
 Himself.
"," Further, beatitude is the last end of the rational
 nature. But to be the last end of the rational nature belongs only to
 God. Therefore the beatitude of every blessed is God alone.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Beatitude, as regards its object, is the supreme good
 absolutely, but as regards its act, in beatified creatures it is
 their supreme good, not absolutely, but in that kind of goods which a
 creature can participate.
"," End is twofold, namely, objective and subjective,
 as the Philosopher says (Greater Ethics i, 3), namely, the ""thing
 itself"" and ""its use."" Thus to a miser the end is money, and its
 acquisition. Accordingly God is indeed the last end of a rational
 creature, as the thing itself; but created beatitude is the end, as
 the use, or rather fruition, of the thing.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
158,"[I, Q. 26, Art. 4]
","Whether All Other Beatitude Is Included in the Beatitude of God?
"," It seems that the divine beatitude does not embrace all
 other beatitudes. For there are some false beatitudes. But nothing
 false can be in God. Therefore the divine beatitude does not embrace
 all other beatitudes.
"," Further, a certain beatitude, according to some, consists
 in things corporeal; as in pleasure, riches, and such like. Now none
 of these have to do with God, since He is incorporeal. Therefore His
 beatitude does not embrace all other beatitudes.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,," A particular kind of beatitude is false according as it
 falls short of the idea of true beatitude; and thus it is not in God.
 But whatever semblance it has, howsoever slight, of beatitude, the
 whole of it pre-exists in the divine beatitude.
"," The good that exists in things corporeal in a corporeal
 manner, is also in God, but in a spiritual manner.

159,"[I, Q. 27, Art. 1]
","Whether There Is Procession in God?
"," It would seem that there cannot be any procession in God.
 For procession signifies outward movement. But in God there is nothing
 mobile, nor anything extraneous. Therefore neither is there procession
 in God.
"," Further, everything which proceeds differs from that whence
 it proceeds. But in God there is no diversity; but supreme
 simplicity. Therefore in God there is no procession.
"," Further, to proceed from another seems to be against the
 nature of the first principle. But God is the first principle, as
 shown above (Q. 2, A. 3). Therefore in God there is no procession.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," This objection comes from the idea of procession in the
 sense of local motion, or of an action tending to external matter, or
 to an exterior effect; which kind of procession does not exist in
 God, as we have explained.
"," Whatever proceeds by way of outward procession is
 necessarily distinct from the source whence it proceeds, whereas,
 whatever proceeds within by an intelligible procession is not
 necessarily distinct; indeed, the more perfectly it proceeds, the
 more closely it is one with the source whence it proceeds. For it is
 clear that the more a thing is understood, the more closely is the
 intellectual conception joined and united to the intelligent agent;
 since the intellect by the very act of understanding is made one with
 the object understood. Thus, as the divine intelligence is the very
 supreme perfection of God (Q. 14, A. 2), the divine Word is of
 necessity perfectly one with the source whence He proceeds, without
 any kind of diversity.
"," To proceed from a principle, so as to be something
 outside and distinct from that principle, is irreconcilable with the
 idea of a first principle; whereas an intimate and uniform procession
 by way of an intelligible act is included in the idea of a first
 principle. For when we call the builder the principle of the house,
 in the idea of such a principle is included that of his art; and it
 would be included in the idea of the first principle were the builder
 the first principle of the house. God, Who is the first principle of
 all things, may be compared to things created as the architect is to
 things designed.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
160,"[I, Q. 27, Art. 2]
","Whether Any Procession in God Can Be Called Generation?
"," It would seem that no procession in God can be called
 generation. For generation is change from non-existence to existence,
 and is opposed to corruption; while matter is the subject of both.
 Nothing of all this belongs to God. Therefore generation cannot exist
 in God.
"," Further, procession exists in God, according to an
 intelligible mode, as above explained (A. 1). But such a process is
 not called generation in us; therefore neither is it to be so called
 in God.
"," Further, anything that is generated derives existence from
 its generator. Therefore such existence is a derived existence. But
 no derived existence can be a self-subsistence. Therefore, since the
 divine existence is self-subsisting (Q. 3, A. 4), it follows that no
 generated existence can be the divine existence. Therefore there is
 no generation in God.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," This objection is based on the idea of generation in
 the first sense, importing the issuing forth from potentiality to
 act; in which sense it is not found in God.
"," The act of human understanding in ourselves is not the
 substance itself of the intellect; hence the word which proceeds
 within us by intelligible operation is not of the same nature as the
 source whence it proceeds; so the idea of generation cannot be
 properly and fully applied to it. But the divine act of intelligence
 is the very substance itself of the one who understands (Q. 14, A.
 4). The Word proceeding therefore proceeds as subsisting in the same
 nature; and so is properly called begotten, and Son. Hence Scripture
 employs terms which denote generation of living things in order to
 signify the procession of the divine Wisdom, namely, conception and
 birth; as is declared in the person of the divine Wisdom, ""The depths
 were not as yet, and I was already conceived; before the hills, I was
 brought forth."" (Prov. 8:24). In our way of understanding we use the
 word ""conception"" in order to signify that in the word of our
 intellect is found the likeness of the thing understood, although
 there be no identity of nature.
"," Not everything derived from another has existence in
 another subject; otherwise we could not say that the whole substance
 of created being comes from God, since there is no subject that could
 receive the whole substance. So, then, what is generated in God
 receives its existence from the generator, not as though that
 existence were received into matter or into a subject (which would
 conflict with the divine self-subsistence); but when we speak of His
 existence as received, we mean that He Who proceeds receives divine
 existence from another; not, however, as if He were other from the
 divine nature. For in the perfection itself of the divine existence
 are contained both the Word intelligibly proceeding and the principle
 of the Word, with whatever belongs to His perfection (Q. 4, A. 2).
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
161,"[I, Q. 27, Art. 3]
","Whether Any Other Procession Exists in God Besides That of the Word?
"," It would seem that no other procession exists in God
 besides the generation of the Word. Because, for whatever reason we
 admit another procession, we should be led to admit yet another, and
 so on to infinitude; which cannot be. Therefore we must stop at the
 first, and hold that there exists only one procession in God.
"," Further, every nature possesses but one mode of
 self-communication; because operations derive unity and diversity
 from their terms. But procession in God is only by way of
 communication of the divine nature. Therefore, as there is only one
 divine nature (Q. 11, A. 4), it follows that only one procession
 exists in God.
"," Further, if any other procession but the intelligible
 procession of the Word existed in God, it could only be the
 procession of love, which is by the operation of the will. But such a
 procession is identified with the intelligible procession of the
 intellect, inasmuch as the will in God is the same as His intellect
 (Q. 19, A. 1). Therefore in God there is no other procession but the
 procession of the Word.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," There is no need to go on to infinitude in the divine
 processions; for the procession which is accomplished within the
 agent in an intellectual nature terminates in the procession of the
 will.
"," All that exists in God, is God (Q. 3, AA. 3, 4);
 whereas the same does not apply to others. Therefore the divine
 nature is communicated by every procession which is not outward, and
 this does not apply to other natures.
"," Though will and intellect are not diverse in God,
 nevertheless the nature of will and intellect requires the
 processions belonging to each of them to exist in a certain order.
 For the procession of love occurs in due order as regards the
 procession of the Word; since nothing can be loved by the will unless
 it is conceived in the intellect. So as there exists a certain order
 of the Word to the principle whence He proceeds, although in God the
 substance of the intellect and its concept are the same; so, although
 in God the will and the intellect are the same, still, inasmuch as
 love requires by its very nature that it proceed only from the
 concept of the intellect, there is a distinction of order between the
 procession of love and the procession of the Word in God.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
162,"[I, Q. 27, Art. 4]
","Whether the Procession of Love in God Is Generation?
"," It would seem that the procession of love in God is
 generation. For what proceeds by way of likeness of nature among
 living things is said to be generated and born. But what proceeds in
 God by way of love proceeds in the likeness of nature; otherwise it
 would be extraneous to the divine nature, and would be an external
 procession. Therefore what proceeds in God by way of love, proceeds
 as generated and born.
"," Further, as similitude is of the nature of the word, so does
 it belong to love. Hence it is said, that ""every beast loves its
 like"" (Ecclus. 13:19). Therefore if the Word is begotten and born by
 way of likeness, it seems becoming that love should proceed by way of
 generation.
"," Further, what is not in any species is not in the genus. So
 if there is a procession of love in God, there ought to be some
 special name besides this common name of procession. But no other
 name is applicable but generation. Therefore the procession of love
 in God is generation.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," All that exists in God is one with the divine nature.
 Hence the proper notion of this or that procession, by which one
 procession is distinguished from another, cannot be on the part of
 this unity: but the proper notion of this or that procession must be
 taken from the order of one procession to another; which order is
 derived from the nature of the will and intellect. Hence, each
 procession in God takes its name from the proper notion of will and
 intellect; the name being imposed to signify what its nature really
 is; and so it is that the Person proceeding as love receives the
 divine nature, but is not said to be born.
"," Likeness belongs in a different way to the word and to
 love. It belongs to the word as being the likeness of the object
 understood, as the thing generated is the likeness of the generator;
 but it belongs to love, not as though love itself were a likeness,
 but because likeness is the principle of loving. Thus it does not
 follow that love is begotten, but that the one begotten is the
 principle of love.
"," We can name God only from creatures (Q. 13, A. 1). As
 in creatures generation is the only principle of communication of
 nature, procession in God has no proper or special name, except that
 of generation. Hence the procession which is not generation has
 remained without a special name; but it can be called spiration, as
 it is the procession of the Spirit.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
163,"[I, Q. 27, Art. 5]
","Whether There Are More Than Two Processions in God?
"," It would seem that there are more than two processions
 in God. As knowledge and will are attributed to God, so is power.
 Therefore, if two processions exist in God, of intellect and will,
 it seems that there must also be a third procession of power.
"," Further, goodness seems to be the greatest principle of
 procession, since goodness is diffusive of itself. Therefore there
 must be a procession of goodness in God.
"," Further, in God there is greater power of fecundity than
 in us. But in us there is not only one procession of the word, but
 there are many: for in us from one word proceeds another; and also
 from one love proceeds another. Therefore in God there are more
 than two processions.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Power is the principle whereby one thing acts on
 another. Hence it is that external action points to power. Thus the
 divine power does not imply the procession of a divine person; but
 is indicated by the procession therefrom of creatures.
"," As Boethius says (De Hebdom.), goodness belongs to
 the essence and not to the operation, unless considered as the
 object of the will.
"," As above explained (Q. 14, A. 5; Q. 19, A. 5), God
 understands all things by one simple act; and by one act also He
 wills all things. Hence there cannot exist in Him a procession of
 Word from Word, nor of Love from Love: for there is in Him only one
 perfect Word, and one perfect Love; thereby being manifested His
 perfect fecundity.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
164,"[I, Q. 28, Art. 1]
","Whether There Are Real Relations in God?
"," It would seem that there are no real relations in God.
 For Boethius says (De Trin. iv), ""All possible predicaments used as
 regards the Godhead refer to the substance; for nothing can be
 predicated relatively."" But whatever really exists in God can be
 predicated of Him. Therefore no real relation exists in God.
"," Further, Boethius says (De Trin. iv) that, ""Relation in the
 Trinity of the Father to the Son, and of both to the Holy Ghost, is
 the relation of the same to the same."" But a relation of this kind is
 only a logical one; for every real relation requires and implies in
 reality two terms. Therefore the divine relations are not real
 relations, but are formed only by the mind.
"," Further, the relation of paternity is the relation of a
 principle. But to say that God is the principle of creatures does not
 import any real relation, but only a logical one. Therefore paternity
 in God is not a real relation; while the same applies for the same
 reason to the other relations in God.
"," Further, the divine generation proceeds by way of an
 intelligible word. But the relations following upon the operation of
 the intellect are logical relations. Therefore paternity and
 filiation in God, consequent upon generation, are only logical
 relations.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," Relationship is not predicated of God according to its
 proper and formal meaning, that is to say, in so far as its proper
 meaning denotes comparison to that in which relation is inherent, but
 only as denoting regard to another. Nevertheless Boethius did not
 wish to exclude relation in God; but he wished to show that it was
 not to be predicated of Him as regards the mode of inherence in
 Himself in the strict meaning of relation; but rather by way of
 relation to another.
"," The relation signified by the term ""the same"" is a
 logical relation only, if in regard to absolutely the same thing;
 because such a relation can exist only in a certain order observed by
 reason as regards the order of anything to itself, according to some
 two aspects thereof. The case is otherwise, however, when things are
 called the same, not numerically, but generically or specifically.
 Thus Boethius likens the divine relations to a relation of identity,
 not in every respect, but only as regards the fact that the substance
 is not diversified by these relations, as neither is it by relation
 of identity.
"," As the creature proceeds from God in diversity of
 nature, God is outside the order of the whole creation, nor does any
 relation to the creature arise from His nature; for He does not
 produce the creature by necessity of His nature, but by His intellect
 and will, as is above explained (Q. 14, AA. 3, 4; Q. 19, A. 8).
 Therefore there is no real relation in God to the creature; whereas
 in creatures there is a real relation to God; because creatures are
 contained under the divine order, and their very nature entails
 dependence on God. On the other hand, the divine processions are in
 one and the same nature. Hence no parallel exists.
"," Relations which result from the mental operation alone
 in the objects understood are logical relations only, inasmuch as
 reason observes them as existing between two objects perceived by the
 mind. Those relations, however, which follow the operation of the
 intellect, and which exist between the word intellectually proceeding
 and the source whence it proceeds, are not logical relations only,
 but are real relations; inasmuch as the intellect and the reason are
 real things, and are really related to that which proceeds from them
 intelligibly; as a corporeal thing is related to that which proceeds
 from it corporeally. Thus paternity and filiation are real relations
 in God.
",,,,,,,,,,,,
165,"[I, Q. 28, Art. 2]
","Whether Relation in God Is the Same As His Essence?
"," It would seem that the divine relation is not the same as
 the divine essence. For Augustine says (De Trin. v) that ""not all that
 is said of God is said of His substance, for we say some things
 relatively, as Father in respect of the Son: but such things do not
 refer to the substance."" Therefore the relation is not the divine
 essence.
"," Further, Augustine says (De Trin. vii) that, ""every relative
 expression is something besides the relation expressed, as master is
 a man, and slave is a man."" Therefore, if relations exist in God,
 there must be something else besides relation in God. This can only
 be His essence. Therefore essence differs from relation.
"," Further, the essence of relation is the being referred to
 another, as the Philosopher says (Praedic. v). So if relation is the
 divine essence, it follows that the divine essence is essentially
 itself a relation to something else; whereas this is repugnant to the
 perfection of the divine essence, which is supremely absolute and
 self-subsisting (Q. 3, A. 4). Therefore relation is not the divine
 essence.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," These words of Augustine do not imply that paternity or
 any other relation which is in God is not in its very being the same
 as the divine essence; but that it is not predicated under the mode
 of substance, as existing in Him to Whom it is applied; but as a
 relation. So there are said to be two predicaments only in God, since
 other predicaments import habitude to that of which they are spoken,
 both in their generic and in their specific nature; but nothing that
 exists in God can have any relation to that wherein it exists or of
 whom it is spoken, except the relation of identity; and this by
 reason of God's supreme simplicity.
"," As the relation which exists in creatures involves not
 only a regard to another, but also something absolute, so the same
 applies to God, yet not in the same way. What is contained in the
 creature above and beyond what is contained in the meaning of
 relation, is something else besides that relation; whereas in God
 there is no distinction, but both are one and the same; and this is
 not perfectly expressed by the word ""relation,"" as if it were
 comprehended in the ordinary meaning of that term. For it was above
 explained (Q. 13, A. 2), in treating of the divine names, that more
 is contained in the perfection of the divine essence than can be
 signified by any name. Hence it does not follow that there exists in
 God anything besides relation in reality; but only in the various
 names imposed by us.
"," If the divine perfection contained only what is
 signified by relative names, it would follow that it is imperfect,
 being thus related to something else; as in the same way, if nothing
 more were contained in it than what is signified by the word
 ""wisdom,"" it would not in that case be a subsistence. But as the
 perfection of the divine essence is greater than can be included in
 any name, it does not follow, if a relative term or any other name
 applied to God signify something imperfect, that the divine essence
 is in any way imperfect; for the divine essence comprehends within
 itself the perfection of every genus (Q. 4, A. 2).
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
166,"[I, Q. 28, Art. 3]
","Whether the Relations in God Are Really Distinguished from Each Other?
"," It would seem that the divine relations are not really
 distinguished from each other. For things which are identified with
 the same, are identified with each other. But every relation in God
 is really the same as the divine essence. Therefore the relations are
 not really distinguished from each other.
"," Further, as paternity and filiation are by name distinguished
 from the divine essence, so likewise are goodness and power. But this
 kind of distinction does not make any real distinction of the divine
 goodness and power. Therefore neither does it make any real
 distinction of paternity and filiation.
"," Further, in God there is no real distinction but that of
 origin. But one relation does not seem to arise from another.
 Therefore the relations are not really distinguished from each other.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," According to the Philosopher (Phys. iii), this argument
 holds, that whatever things are identified with the same thing are
 identified with each other, if the identity be real and logical; as,
 for instance, a tunic and a garment; but not if they differ
 logically. Hence in the same place he says that although action is
 the same as motion, and likewise passion; still it does not follow
 that action and passion are the same; because action implies
 reference as of something ""from which"" there is motion in the thing
 moved; whereas passion implies reference as of something ""which is
 from"" another. Likewise, although paternity, just as filiation, is
 really the same as the divine essence; nevertheless these two in
 their own proper idea and definitions import opposite respects. Hence
 they are distinguished from each other.
"," Power and goodness do not import any opposition in
 their respective natures; and hence there is no parallel argument.
"," Although relations, properly speaking, do not arise or
 proceed from each other, nevertheless they are considered as opposed
 according to the procession of one from another.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
167,"[I, Q. 28, Art. 3]
","Whether in God There Are Only Four Real Relations--Paternity,
"," It would seem that in God there are not only four real
 relations--paternity, filiation, spiration and procession. For it
 must be observed that in God there exist the relations of the
 intelligent agent to the object understood; and of the one willing to
 the object willed; which are real relations not comprised under those
 above specified. Therefore there are not only four real relations in
 God.
"," Further, real relations in God are understood as coming
 from the intelligible procession of the Word. But intelligible
 relations are infinitely multiplied, as Avicenna says. Therefore
 in God there exists an infinite series of real relations.
"," Further, ideas in God are eternal (Q. 15, A. 1); and are only
 distinguished from each other by reason of their regard to things, as
 above stated. Therefore in God there are many more eternal relations.
"," Further, equality, and likeness, and identity are relations:
 and they are in God from eternity. Therefore several more relations
 are eternal in God than the above named.
"," Further, it may also contrariwise be said that there are
 fewer relations in God than those above named. For, according to the
 Philosopher (Phys. iii text 24), ""It is the same way from Athens to
 Thebes, as from Thebes to Athens."" By the same way of reasoning there
 is the same relation from the Father to the Son, that of paternity,
 and from the Son to the Father, that of filiation; and thus there are
 not four relations in God.
",,,,,,,,,,,,," In those things in which there is a difference between
 the intellect and its object, and the will and its object, there can
 be a real relation, both of science to its object, and of the willer
 to the object willed. In God, however, the intellect and its object
 are one and the same; because by understanding Himself, God
 understands all other things; and the same applies to His will and
 the object that He wills. Hence it follows that in God these kinds of
 relations are not real; as neither is the relation of a thing to
 itself. Nevertheless, the relation to the word is a real relation;
 because the word is understood as proceeding by an intelligible
 action; and not as a thing understood. For when we understand a
 stone; that which the intellect conceives from the thing understood,
 is called the word.
"," Intelligible relations in ourselves are infinitely
 multiplied, because a man understands a stone by one act, and by
 another act understands that he understands the stone, and again by
 another, understands that he understands this; thus the acts of
 understanding are infinitely multiplied, and consequently also the
 relations understood. This does not apply to God, inasmuch as He
 understands all things by one act alone.
"," Ideal relations exist as understood by God. Hence it
 does not follow from their plurality that there are many relations in
 God; but that God knows these many relations.
"," Equality and similitude in God are not real relations;
 but are only logical relations (Q. 42, A. 3, ad 4).
"," The way from one term to another and conversely is the
 same; nevertheless the mutual relations are not the same. Hence, we
 cannot conclude that the relation of the father to the son is the
 same as that of the son to the father; but we could conclude this of
 something absolute, if there were such between them.

","The Definition of ""Person""
"," It would seem that the definition of person given by
 Boethius (De Duab. Nat.) is insufficient--that is, ""a person is an
 individual substance of a rational nature."" For nothing singular can
 be subject to definition. But ""person"" signifies something singular.
 Therefore person is improperly defined.
"," Further, substance as placed above in the definition of
 person, is either first substance, or second substance. If it is the
 former, the word ""individual"" is superfluous, because first substance
 is individual substance; if it stands for second substance, the word
 ""individual"" is false, for there is contradiction of terms; since
 second substances are the genera or species. Therefore this
 definition is incorrect.
"," Further, an intentional term must not be included in the
 definition of a thing. For to define a man as ""a species of animal""
 would not be a correct definition; since man is the name of a thing,
 and species is a name of an intention. Therefore, since person is
 the name of a thing (for it signifies a substance of a rational
 nature), the word ""individual"" which is an intentional name comes
 improperly into the definition.
"," Further, ""Nature is the principle of motion and rest, in
 those things in which it is essentially, and not accidentally,"" as
 Aristotle says (Phys. ii). But person exists in things immovable, as
 in God, and in the angels. Therefore the word ""nature"" ought not to
 enter into the definition of person, but the word should rather be
 ""essence.""
"," Further, the separated soul is an individual substance of
 the rational nature; but it is not a person. Therefore person is not
 properly defined as above.
",,,,,,,,,,,,," Although this or that singular may not be definable,
 yet what belongs to the general idea of singularity can be defined;
 and so the Philosopher (De Praedic., cap. De substantia) gives a
 definition of first substance; and in this way Boethius defines
 person.
"," In the opinion of some, the term ""substance"" in the
 definition of person stands for first substance, which is the
 hypostasis; nor is the term ""individual"" superfluously added,
 forasmuch as by the name of hypostasis or first substance the idea of
 universality and of part is excluded. For we do not say that man in
 general is an hypostasis, nor that the hand is since it is only a
 part. But where ""individual"" is added, the idea of assumptibility is
 excluded from person; for the human nature in Christ is not a person,
 since it is assumed by a greater--that is, by the Word of God. It is,
 however, better to say that substance is here taken in a general
 sense, as divided into first and second, and when ""individual"" is
 added, it is restricted to first substance.
"," Substantial differences being unknown to us, or at
 least unnamed by us, it is sometimes necessary to use accidental
 differences in the place of substantial; as, for example, we may say
 that fire is a simple, hot, and dry body: for proper accidents are
 the effects of substantial forms, and make them known. Likewise,
 terms expressive of intention can be used in defining realities if
 used to signify things which are unnamed. And so the term
 ""individual"" is placed in the definition of person to signify the
 mode of subsistence which belongs to particular substances.
"," According to the Philosopher (Metaph. v, 5), the word
 ""nature"" was first used to signify the generation of living things,
 which is called nativity. And because this kind of generation comes
 from an intrinsic principle, this term is extended to signify the
 intrinsic principle of any kind of movement. In this sense he defines
 ""nature"" (Phys. ii, 3). And since this kind of principle is either
 formal or material, both matter and form are commonly called nature.
 And as the essence of anything is completed by the form; so the
 essence of anything, signified by the definition, is commonly called
 nature. And here nature is taken in that sense. Hence Boethius says
 (De Duab. Nat.) that, ""nature is the specific difference giving its
 form to each thing,"" for the specific difference completes the
 definition, and is derived from the special form of a thing. So in
 the definition of ""person,"" which means the singular in a determined
 genus, it is more correct to use the term ""nature"" than ""essence,""
 because the latter is taken from being, which is most common.
"," The soul is a part of the human species; and so,
 although it may exist in a separate state, yet since it ever retains
 its nature of unibility, it cannot be called an individual substance,
 which is the hypostasis or first substance, as neither can the hand
 nor any other part of man; thus neither the definition nor the name
 of person belongs to it.

169,"[I, Q. 29, Art. 2]
","Whether ""Person"" Is the Same As Hypostasis, Subsistence, and Essence?
"," It would seem that ""person"" is the same as ""hypostasis,""
 ""subsistence,"" and ""essence."" For Boethius says (De Duab. Nat.) that
 ""the Greeks called the individual substance of the rational nature by
 the name hypostasis."" But this with us signifies ""person."" Therefore
 ""person"" is altogether the same as ""hypostasis.""
"," Further, as we say there are three persons in God, so we say
 there are three subsistences in God; which implies that ""person"" and
 ""subsistence"" have the same meaning. Therefore ""person"" and
 ""subsistence"" mean the same.
"," Further, Boethius says (Com. Praed.) that the Greek ousia,
 which means essence, signifies a being composed of matter and form.
 Now that which is composed of matter and form is the individual
 substance called ""hypostasis"" and ""person."" Therefore all the
 aforesaid names seem to have the same meaning.
"," On the contrary, Boethius says (De Duab. Nat.) that genera
 and species only subsist; whereas individuals are not only
 subsistent, but also substand. But subsistences are so called from
 subsisting, as substance or hypostasis is so called from substanding.
 Therefore, since genera and species are not hypostases or persons,
 these are not the same as subsistences.
"," Further, Boethius says (Com. Praed.) that matter is called
 hypostasis, and form is called ousiosis--that is, subsistence. But
 neither form nor matter can be called person. Therefore person
 differs from the others.
",,,,,,,,,,,,," Among the Greeks the term ""hypostasis,"" taken in the
 strict interpretation of the word, signifies any individual of the
 genus substance; but in the usual way of speaking, it means the
 individual of the rational nature, by reason of the excellence of
 that nature.
"," As we say ""three persons"" plurally in God, and ""three
 subsistences,"" so the Greeks say ""three hypostases."" But because the
 word ""substance,"" which, properly speaking, corresponds in meaning to
 ""hypostasis,"" is used among us in an equivocal sense, since it
 sometimes means essence, and sometimes means hypostasis, in order to
 avoid any occasion of error, it was thought preferable to use
 ""subsistence"" for hypostasis, rather than ""substance.""
"," Strictly speaking, the essence is what is expressed by
 the definition. Now, the definition comprises the principles of the
 species, but not the individual principles. Hence in things composed
 of matter and form, the essence signifies not only the form, nor only
 the matter, but what is composed of matter and the common form, as
 the principles of the species. But what is composed of this matter
 and this form has the nature of hypostasis and person. For soul,
 flesh, and bone belong to the nature of man; whereas this soul, this
 flesh and this bone belong to the nature of this man. Therefore
 hypostasis and person add the individual principles to the idea of
 essence; nor are these identified with the essence in things composed
 of matter and form, as we said above when treating of divine
 simplicity (Q. 3, A. 3).
"," Boethius says that genera and species subsist, inasmuch
 as it belongs to some individual things to subsist, from the fact
 that they belong to genera and species comprised in the predicament
 of substance, but not because the species and genera themselves
 subsist; except in the opinion of Plato, who asserted that the
 species of things subsisted separately from singular things. To
 substand, however, belongs to the same individual things in relation
 to the accidents, which are outside the essence of genera and species.
"," The individual composed of matter and form substands in
 relation to accident from the very nature of matter. Hence Boethius
 says (De Trin.): ""A simple form cannot be a subject."" Its
 self-subsistence is derived from the nature of its form, which does
 not supervene to the things subsisting, but gives actual existence to
 the matter and makes it subsist as an individual. On this account,
 therefore, he ascribes hypostasis to matter, and ousiosis, or
 subsistence, to the form, because the matter is the principle of
 substanding, and form is the principle of subsisting.
",,,,,,,,,,,
170,"[I, Q. 29, Art. 3]
","Whether the Word ""Person"" Should Be Said of God?
"," It would seem that the name ""person"" should not be said
 of God. For Dionysius says (Div. Nom.): ""No one should ever dare to
 say or think anything of the supersubstantial and hidden Divinity,
 beyond what has been divinely expressed to us by the oracles."" But the
 name ""person"" is not expressed to us in the Old or New Testament.
 Therefore ""person"" is not to be applied to God.
"," Further, Boethius says (De Duab. Nat.): ""The word person
 seems to be taken from those persons who represented men in comedies
 and tragedies. For person comes from sounding through [personando],
 since a greater volume of sound is produced through the cavity in the
 mask. These ""persons"" or masks the Greeks called prosopa, as they
 were placed on the face and covered the features before the eyes.""
 This, however, can apply to God only in a metaphorical sense.
 Therefore the word ""person"" is only applied to God metaphorically.
"," Further, every person is a hypostasis. But the word
 ""hypostasis"" does not apply to God, since, as Boethius says (De Duab.
 Nat.), it signifies what is the subject of accidents, which do not
 exist in God. Jerome also says (Ep. ad Damas.) that, ""in this word
 hypostasis, poison lurks in honey."" Therefore the word ""person""
 should not be said of God.
"," Further, if a definition is denied of anything, the thing
 defined is also denied of it. But the definition of ""person,"" as
 given above, does not apply to God. Both because reason implies a
 discursive knowledge, which does not apply to God, as we proved above
 (Q. 14, A. 12); and thus God cannot be said to have ""a rational
 nature."" And also because God cannot be called an individual
 substance, since the principle of individuation is matter; while God
 is immaterial: nor is He the subject of accidents, so as to be called
 a substance. Therefore the word ""person"" ought not to be attributed
 to God.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," Although the word ""person"" is not found applied to God
 in Scripture, either in the Old or New Testament, nevertheless what
 the word signifies is found to be affirmed of God in many places of
 Scripture; as that He is the supreme self-subsisting being, and the
 most perfectly intelligent being. If we could speak of God only in
 the very terms themselves of Scripture, it would follow that no one
 could speak about God in any but the original language of the Old or
 New Testament. The urgency of confuting heretics made it necessary to
 find new words to express the ancient faith about God. Nor is such a
 kind of novelty to be shunned; since it is by no means profane, for
 it does not lead us astray from the sense of Scripture. The Apostle
 warns us to avoid ""profane novelties of words"" (1 Tim. 6:20).
"," Although this name ""person"" may not belong to God as
 regards the origin of the term, nevertheless it excellently belongs
 to God in its objective meaning. For as famous men were represented
 in comedies and tragedies, the name ""person"" was given to signify
 those who held high dignity. Hence, those who held high rank in the
 Church came to be called ""persons."" Thence by some the definition of
 person is given as ""hypostasis distinct by reason of dignity."" And
 because subsistence in a rational nature is of high dignity,
 therefore every individual of the rational nature is called a
 ""person."" Now the dignity of the divine nature excels every other
 dignity; and thus the name ""person"" pre-eminently belongs to God.
"," The word ""hypostasis"" does not apply to God as regards
 its source of origin, since He does not underlie accidents; but it
 applies to Him in its objective sense, for it is imposed to signify
 the subsistence. Jerome said that ""poison lurks in this word,""
 forasmuch as before it was fully understood by the Latins, the
 heretics used this term to deceive the simple, to make people profess
 many essences as they profess several hypostases, inasmuch as the
 word ""substance,"" which corresponds to hypostasis in Greek, is
 commonly taken amongst us to mean essence.
"," It may be said that God has a rational nature, if
 reason be taken to mean, not discursive thought, but in a general
 sense, an intelligent nature. But God cannot be called an
 ""individual"" in the sense that His individuality comes from matter;
 but only in the sense which implies incommunicability. ""Substance""
 can be applied to God in the sense of signifying self-subsistence.
 There are some, however, who say that the definition of Boethius,
 quoted above (A. 1), is not a definition of person in the sense we
 use when speaking of persons in God. Therefore Richard of St. Victor
 amends this definition by adding that ""Person"" in God is ""the
 incommunicable existence of the divine nature.""
",,,,,,,,,,,,
171,"[I, Q. 29, Art. 4]
","Whether This Word ""Person"" Signifies Relation?
"," It would seem that this word ""person,"" as applied to God,
 does not signify relation, but substance. For Augustine says (De Trin.
 vii, 6): ""When we speak of the person of the Father, we mean nothing
 else but the substance of the Father, for person is said in regard to
 Himself, and not in regard to the Son.""
"," Further, the interrogation ""What?"" refers to essence. But, as
 Augustine says: ""When we say there are three who bear witness in
 heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost, and it is asked,
 Three what? the answer is, Three persons."" Therefore person signifies
 essence.
"," According to the Philosopher (Metaph. iv), the meaning of a
 word is its definition. But the definition of ""person"" is this: ""The
 individual substance of the rational nature,"" as above stated.
 Therefore ""person"" signifies substance.
"," Further, person in men and angels does not signify relation,
 but something absolute. Therefore, if in God it signified relation,
 it would bear an equivocal meaning in God, in man, and in angels.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," This word ""person"" is said in respect to itself, not to
 another; forasmuch as it signifies relation not as such, but by way
 of a substance--which is a hypostasis. In that sense Augustine says
 that it signifies the essence, inasmuch as in God essence is the same
 as the hypostasis, because in God what He is, and whereby He is are
 the same.
"," The term ""what"" refers sometimes to the nature
 expressed by the definition, as when we ask; What is man? and we
 answer: A mortal rational animal. Sometimes it refers to the
 suppositum, as when we ask, What swims in the sea? and answer, A
 fish. So to those who ask, Three what? we answer, Three persons.
"," In God the individual--i.e. distinct and incommunicable
 substance--includes the idea of relation, as above explained.
"," The different sense of the less common term does not
 produce equivocation in the more common. Although a horse and an ass
 have their own proper definitions, nevertheless they agree univocally
 in animal, because the common definition of animal applies to both.
 So it does not follow that, although relation is contained in the
 signification of divine person, but not in that of an angelic or of a
 human person, the word ""person"" is used in an equivocal sense. Though
 neither is it applied univocally, since nothing can be said
 univocally of God and creatures (Q. 13, A. 5).
",,,,,,,,,,,,
172,"[I, Q. 30, Art. 1]
","Whether There Are Several Persons in God?
"," It would seem that there are not several persons in God.
 For person is ""the individual substance of a rational nature."" If then
 there are several persons in God, there must be several substances;
 which appears to be heretical.
"," Further, Plurality of absolute properties does not make a
 distinction of persons, either in God, or in ourselves. Much less
 therefore is this effected by a plurality of relations. But in God
 there is no plurality but of relations (Q. 28, A. 3). Therefore
 there cannot be several persons in God.
"," Further, Boethius says of God (De Trin. i), that ""this is
 truly one which has no number."" But plurality implies number.
 Therefore there are not several persons in God.
"," Further, where number is, there is whole and part. Thus,
 if in God there exist a number of persons, there must be whole and
 part in God; which is inconsistent with the divine simplicity.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," The definition of ""person"" includes ""substance,"" not as
 meaning the essence, but the suppositum which is made clear by the
 addition of the term ""individual."" To signify the substance thus
 understood, the Greeks use the name ""hypostasis."" So, as we say,
 ""Three persons,"" they say ""Three hypostases."" We are not, however,
 accustomed to say Three substances, lest we be understood to mean
 three essences or natures, by reason of the equivocal signification
 of the term.
"," The absolute properties in God, such as goodness and
 wisdom, are not mutually opposed; and hence, neither are they really
 distinguished from each other. Therefore, although they subsist,
 nevertheless they are not several subsistent realities--that is,
 several persons. But the absolute properties in creatures do not
 subsist, although they are really distinguished from each other, as
 whiteness and sweetness; on the other hand, the relative properties
 in God subsist, and are really distinguished from each other (Q. 28,
 A. 3). Hence the plurality of persons in God.
"," The supreme unity and simplicity of God exclude every
 kind of plurality of absolute things, but not plurality of relations.
 Because relations are predicated relatively, and thus the relations
 do not import composition in that of which they are predicated, as
 Boethius teaches in the same book.
"," Number is twofold, simple or absolute, as two and three
 and four; and number as existing in things numbered, as two men and
 two horses. So, if number in God is taken absolutely or abstractedly,
 there is nothing to prevent whole and part from being in Him, and
 thus number in Him is only in our way of understanding; forasmuch as
 number regarded apart from things numbered exists only in the
 intellect. But if number be taken as it is in the things numbered, in
 that sense as existing in creatures, one is part of two, and two of
 three, as one man is part of two men, and two of three; but this does
 not apply to God, because the Father is of the same magnitude as the
 whole Trinity, as we shall show further on (Q. 42, AA. 1, 4).
",,,,,,,,,,,,
173,"[I, Q. 30, Art. 2]
","Whether There Are More Than Three Persons in God?
"," It would seem that there are more than three persons in
 God. For the plurality of persons in God arises from the plurality of
 the relative properties as stated above (A. 1). But there are four
 relations in God as stated above (Q. 28, A. 4), paternity, filiation,
 common spiration, and procession. Therefore there are four persons in
 God.
"," The nature of God does not differ from His will more than
 from His intellect. But in God, one person proceeds from the will, as
 love; and another proceeds from His nature, as Son. Therefore another
 proceeds from His intellect, as Word, besides the one Who proceeds
 from His nature, as Son; thus again it follows that there are not
 only three persons in God.
"," Further, the more perfect a creature is, the more interior
 operations it has; as a man has understanding and will beyond other
 animals. But God infinitely excels every creature. Therefore in God
 not only is there a person proceeding from the will, and another from
 the intellect, but also in an infinite number of ways. Therefore
 there are an infinite number of persons in God.
"," Further, it is from the infinite goodness of the Father that
 He communicates Himself infinitely in the production of a divine
 person. But also in the Holy Ghost is infinite goodness. Therefore
 the Holy Ghost produces a divine person; and that person another; and
 so to infinity.
"," Further, everything within a determinate number is measured,
 for number is a measure. But the divine persons are immense, as we
 say in the Creed of Athanasius: ""The Father is immense, the Son is
 immense, the Holy Ghost is immense."" Therefore the persons are not
 contained within the number three.
",,,,,,,,,,,,," Although there are four relations in God, one of them,
 spiration, is not separated from the person of the Father and of the
 Son, but belongs to both; thus, although it is a relation, it is not
 called a property, because it does not belong to only one person; nor
 is it a personal relation--i.e. constituting a person. The three
 relations--paternity, filiation, and procession--are called personal
 properties, constituting as it were the persons; for paternity is the
 person of the Father, filiation is the person of the Son, procession
 is the person of the Holy Ghost proceeding.
"," That which proceeds by way of intelligence, as word,
 proceeds according to similitude, as also that which proceeds by way
 of nature; thus, as above explained (Q. 27, A. 3), the procession of
 the divine Word is the very same as generation by way of nature. But
 love, as such, does not proceed as the similitude of that whence it
 proceeds; although in God love is co-essential as being divine; and
 therefore the procession of love is not called generation in God.
"," As man is more perfect than other animals, he has more
 intrinsic operations than other animals, because his perfection is
 something composite. Hence the angels, who are more perfect and more
 simple, have fewer intrinsic operations than man, for they have no
 imagination, or feeling, or the like. In God there exists only one
 real operation--that is, His essence. How there are in Him two
 processions was above explained (Q. 27, AA. 1, 4).
"," This argument would prove if the Holy Ghost possessed
 another goodness apart from the goodness of the Father; for then if
 the Father produced a divine person by His goodness, the Holy Ghost
 also would do so. But the Father and the Holy Ghost have one and the
 same goodness. Nor is there any distinction between them except by
 the personal relations. So goodness belongs to the Holy Ghost, as
 derived from another; and it belongs to the Father, as the principle
 of its communication to another. The opposition of relation does not
 allow the relation of the Holy Ghost to be joined with the relation
 of principle of another divine person; because He Himself proceeds
 from the other persons who are in God.
"," A determinate number, if taken as a simple number,
 existing in the mind only, is measured by one. But when we speak of a
 number of things as applied to the persons in God, the notion of
 measure has no place, because the magnitude of the three persons is
 the same (Q. 42, AA. 1, 4), and the same is not measured by the same.
",,,,,,,,,,,
174,"[I, Q. 30, Art. 3]
","Whether the Numeral Terms Denote Anything Real in God?
"," It would seem that the numeral terms denote something
 real in God. For the divine unity is the divine essence. But every
 number is unity repeated. Therefore every numeral term in God
 signifies the essence; and therefore it denotes something real in
 God.
"," Further, whatever is said of God and of creatures, belongs to
 God in a more eminent manner than to creatures. But the numeral terms
 denote something real in creatures; therefore much more so in God.
"," Further, if the numeral terms do not denote anything real in
 God, and are introduced simply in a negative and removing sense, as
 plurality is employed to remove unity, and unity to remove plurality;
 it follows that a vicious circle results, confusing the mind and
 obscuring the truth; and this ought not to be. Therefore it must be
 said that the numeral terms denote something real in God.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," One, as it is a transcendental, is wider and more
 general than substance and relation. And so likewise is multitude;
 hence in God it may mean both substance and relation, according to
 the context. Still, the very signification of such names adds a
 negation of division, beyond substance and relation; as was explained
 above.
"," Multitude, which denotes something real in creatures,
 is a species of quantity, and cannot be used when speaking of God:
 unlike transcendental multitude, which adds only indivision to those
 of which it is predicated. Such a kind of multitude is applicable to
 God.
"," ""One"" does not exclude multitude, but division, which
 logically precedes one or multitude. Multitude does not remove unity,
 but division from each of the individuals which compose the
 multitude. This was explained when we treated of the divine unity (Q.
 11, A. 2).
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
175,"[I, Q. 30, Art. 4]
","Whether This Term ""Person"" Can Be Common to the Three Persons?
"," It would seem that this term ""person"" cannot be common to
 the three persons. For nothing is common to the three persons but the
 essence. But this term ""person"" does not signify the essence directly.
 Therefore it is not common to all three.
"," Further, the common is the opposite to the incommunicable.
 But the very meaning of person is that it is incommunicable; as
 appears from the definition given by Richard of St. Victor (Q. 29, A.
 3, ad 4). Therefore this term ""person"" is not common to all the three
 persons.
"," Further, if the name ""person"" is common to the three, it is
 common either really, or logically. But it is not so really;
 otherwise the three persons would be one person; nor again is it so
 logically; otherwise person would be a universal. But in God there is
 neither universal nor particular; neither genus nor species, as we
 proved above (Q. 3, A. 5). Therefore this term 'person' is not common
 to the three.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," This argument is founded on a real community.
"," Although person is incommunicable, yet the mode itself
 of incommunicable existence can be common to many.
"," Although this community is logical and not real, yet it
 does not follow that in God there is universal or particular, or
 genus, or species; both because neither in human affairs is the
 community of person the same as community of genus or species; and
 because the divine persons have one being; whereas genus and species
 and every other universal are predicated of many which differ in
 being.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
176,"[I, Q. 31, Art. 1]
","Whether There Is Trinity in God?
"," It would seem there is not trinity in God. For every name
 in God signifies substance or relation. But this name ""Trinity"" does
 not signify the substance; otherwise it would be predicated of each
 one of the persons: nor does it signify relation; for it does not
 express a name that refers to another. Therefore the word ""Trinity"" is
 not to be applied to God.
"," Further, this word ""trinity"" is a collective term, since it
 signifies multitude. But such a word does not apply to God; as the
 unity of a collective name is the least of unities, whereas in God
 there exists the greatest possible unity. Therefore this word
 ""trinity"" does not apply to God.
"," Further, every trine is threefold. But in God there is not
 triplicity; since triplicity is a kind of inequality. Therefore
 neither is there trinity in God.
"," Further, all that exists in God exists in the unity of the
 divine essence; because God is His own essence. Therefore, if Trinity
 exists in God, it exists in the unity of the divine essence; and thus
 in God there would be three essential unities; which is heresy.
"," Further, in all that is said of God, the concrete is
 predicated of the abstract; for Deity is God and paternity is the
 Father. But the Trinity cannot be called trine; otherwise there would
 be nine realities in God; which, of course, is erroneous. Therefore
 the word trinity is not to be applied to God.
",,,,,,,,,,,,," In its etymological sense, this word ""Trinity"" seems to
 signify the one essence of the three persons, according as trinity
 may mean trine-unity. But in the strict meaning of the term it rather
 signifies the number of persons of one essence; and on this account
 we cannot say that the Father is the Trinity, as He is not three
 persons. Yet it does not mean the relations themselves of the
 Persons, but rather the number of persons related to each other; and
 hence it is that the word in itself does not express regard to
 another.
"," Two things are implied in a collective term, plurality
 of the supposita, and a unity of some kind of order. For ""people""
 is a multitude of men comprehended under a certain order. In the
 first sense, this word ""trinity"" is like other collective words; but
 in the second sense it differs from them, because in the divine
 Trinity not only is there unity of order, but also with this there is
 unity of essence.
"," ""Trinity"" is taken in an absolute sense; for it
 signifies the threefold number of persons. ""Triplicity"" signifies a
 proportion of inequality; for it is a species of unequal proportion,
 according to Boethius (Arithm. i, 23). Therefore in God there is not
 triplicity, but Trinity.
"," In the divine Trinity is to be understood both number
 and the persons numbered. So when we say, ""Trinity in Unity,"" we do
 not place number in the unity of the essence, as if we meant three
 times one; but we place the Persons numbered in the unity of nature;
 as the supposita of a nature are said to exist in that nature. On
 the other hand, we say ""Unity in Trinity""; meaning that the nature is
 in its supposita.
"," When we say, ""Trinity is trine,"" by reason of the
 number implied, we signify the multiplication of that number by
 itself; since the word trine imports a distinction in the supposita
 of which it is spoken. Therefore it cannot be said that the Trinity
 is trine; otherwise it follows that, if the Trinity be trine, there
 would be three supposita of the Trinity; as when we say, ""God is
 trine,"" it follows that there are three supposita of the Godhead.
",,,,,,,,,,,
177,"[I, Q. 31, Art. 2]
","Whether the Son Is Other Than the Father?
"," It would seem that the Son is not other than the Father.
 For ""other"" is a relative term implying diversity of substance. If,
 then, the Son is other than the Father, He must be different from the
 Father; which is contrary to what Augustine says (De Trin. vii), that
 when we speak of three persons, ""we do not mean to imply diversity.""
"," Further, whosoever are other from one another, differ in
 some way from one another. Therefore, if the Son is other than the
 Father, it follows that He differs from the Father; which is against
 what Ambrose says (De Fide i), that ""the Father and the Son are one
 in Godhead; nor is there any difference in substance between them,
 nor any diversity.""
"," Further, the term alien is taken from alius (other).
 But the Son is not alien from the Father, for Hilary says (De Trin.
 vii) that ""in the divine persons there is nothing diverse, nothing
 alien, nothing separable."" Therefore the Son is not other than the
 Father.
"," Further, the terms ""other person"" and ""other thing"" [alius et
 aliud] have the same meaning, differing only in gender. So if the Son
 is another person from the Father, it follows that the Son is a thing
 apart from the Father.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," ""Other,"" being like the name of a particular thing,
 refers to the suppositum; and so, there is sufficient reason for
 using it, where there is a distinct substance in the sense of
 hypostasis or person. But diversity requires a distinct substance in
 the sense of essence. Thus we cannot say that the Son is diverse from
 the Father, although He is another.
"," ""Difference"" implies distinction of form. There is one
 form in God, as appears from the text, ""Who, when He was in the form
 of God"" (Phil. 2:6). Therefore the term ""difference"" does not
 properly apply to God, as appears from the authority quoted. Yet,
 Damascene (De Fide Orth. i, 5) employs the term ""difference"" in the
 divine persons, as meaning that the relative property is signified by
 way of form. Hence he says that the hypostases do not differ from
 each other in substance, but according to determinate properties. But
 ""difference"" is taken for ""distinction,"" as above stated.
"," The term ""alien"" means what is extraneous and
 dissimilar; which is not expressed by the term ""other"" [alius]; and
 therefore we say that the Son is ""other"" than the Father, but not
 that He is anything ""alien.""
"," The neuter gender is formless; whereas the masculine is
 formed and distinct; and so is the feminine. So the common essence is
 properly and aptly expressed by the neuter gender, but by the
 masculine and feminine is expressed the determined subject in the
 common nature. Hence also in human affairs, if we ask, Who is this
 man? we answer, Socrates, which is the name of the suppositum;
 whereas, if we ask, What is he? we reply, A rational and mortal
 animal. So, because in God distinction is by the persons, and not by
 the essence, we say that the Father is other than the Son, but not
 something else; while conversely we say that they are one thing, but
 not one person.

178,"[I, Q. 31, Art. 3]
","Whether the Exclusive Word ""Alone"" Should Be Added to the Essential
"," It would seem that the exclusive word ""alone"" [solus] is
 not to be added to an essential term in God. For, according to the
 Philosopher (Elench. ii, 3), ""He is alone who is not with another.""
 But God is with the angels and the souls of the saints. Therefore we
 cannot say that God is alone.
"," Further, whatever is joined to the essential term in God can
 be predicated of every person per se, and of all the persons
 together; for, as we can properly say that God is wise, we can say
 the Father is a wise God; and the Trinity is a wise God. But
 Augustine says (De Trin. vi, 9): ""We must consider the opinion that
 the Father is not true God alone."" Therefore God cannot be said to be
 alone.
"," Further if this expression ""alone"" is joined to an essential
 term, it would be so joined as regards either the personal predicate
 or the essential predicate. But it cannot be the former, as it is
 false to say, ""God alone is Father,"" since man also is a father; nor,
 again, can it be applied as regards the latter, for, if this saying
 were true, ""God alone creates,"" it would follow that the ""Father
 alone creates,"" as whatever is said of God can be said of the Father;
 and it would be false, as the Son also creates. Therefore this
 expression ""alone"" cannot be joined to an essential term in God.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Although the angels and the souls of the saints are
 always with God, nevertheless, if plurality of persons did not exist
 in God, He would be alone or solitary. For solitude is not removed by
 association with anything that is extraneous in nature; thus anyone
 is said to be alone in a garden, though many plants and animals are
 with him in the garden. Likewise, God would be alone or solitary,
 though angels and men were with Him, supposing that several persons
 were not within Him. Therefore the society of angels and of souls
 does not take away absolute solitude from God; much less does it
 remove respective solitude, in reference to a predicate.
"," This expression ""alone,"" properly speaking, does not
 affect the predicate, which is taken formally, for it refers to the
 suppositum, as excluding any other suppositum from the one which it
 qualifies. But the adverb ""only,"" being exclusive, can be applied
 either to subject or predicate. For we can say, ""Only Socrates""--that
 is, no one else--""runs: and Socrates runs only""--that is, he does
 nothing else. Hence it is not properly said that the Father is God
 alone, or the Trinity is God alone, unless some implied meaning be
 assumed in the predicate, as, for instance, ""The Trinity is God Who
 alone is God."" In that sense it can be true to say that the Father is
 that God Who alone is God, if the relative be referred to the
 predicate, and not to the suppositum. So, when Augustine says that
 the Father is not God alone, but that the Trinity is God alone, he
 speaks expositively, as he might explain the words, ""To the King of
 ages, invisible, the only God,"" as applying not to the Father, but to
 the Trinity alone.
"," In both ways can the term ""alone"" be joined to an
 essential term. For this proposition, ""God alone is Father,"" can mean
 two things, because the word ""Father"" can signify the person of the
 Father; and then it is true; for no man is that person: or it can
 signify that relation only; and thus it is false, because the
 relation of paternity is found also in others, though not in a
 univocal sense. Likewise it is true to say God alone creates; nor,
 does it follow, ""therefore the Father alone creates,"" because, as
 logicians say, an exclusive diction so fixes the term to which it is
 joined that what is said exclusively of that term cannot be said
 exclusively of an individual contained in that term: for instance,
 from the premiss, ""Man alone is a mortal rational animal,"" we cannot
 conclude, ""therefore Socrates alone is such.""
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
179,"[I, Q. 31, Art. 4]
","Whether an Exclusive Diction Can Be Joined to the Personal Term?
"," It would seem that an exclusive diction can be joined to
 the personal term, even though the predicate is common. For our Lord
 speaking to the Father, said: ""That they may know Thee, the only true
 God"" (John 17:3). Therefore the Father alone is true God.
"," Further, He said: ""No one knows the Son but the Father"" (Matt.
 11:27); which means that the Father alone knows the Son. But to know
 the Son is common (to the persons). Therefore the same conclusion
 follows.
"," Further, an exclusive diction does not exclude what enters
 into the concept of the term to which it is joined. Hence it does not
 exclude the part, nor the universal; for it does not follow that if
 we say ""Socrates alone is white,"" that therefore ""his hand is not
 white,"" or that ""man is not white."" But one person is in the
 concept of another; as the Father is in the concept of the Son; and
 conversely. Therefore, when we say, The Father alone is God, we do
 not exclude the Son, nor the Holy Ghost; so that such a mode of
 speaking is true.
"," Further, the Church sings: ""Thou alone art Most High, O Jesus
 Christ.""
"," The same Reply can be given to Obj. 2. For an essential term applied
 to the Father does not exclude the Son or the Holy Ghost, by reason of
 the unity of essence. Hence we must understand that in the text quoted
 the term ""no one"" [*Nemo = non-homo, i.e. no man] is not the same as
 ""no man,"" which the word itself would seem to signify (for the person
 of the Father could not be excepted), but is taken according to the
 usual way of speaking in a distributive sense, to mean any rational
 nature.
",,,,,,,,,,,,," When we say, ""Thee the only true God,"" we do not
 understand it as referring to the person of the Father, but to the
 whole Trinity, as Augustine expounds (De Trin. vi, 9). Or, if
 understood of the person of the Father, the other persons are not
 excluded by reason of the unity of essence; in so far as the word
 ""only"" excludes another thing, as above explained.
"," The exclusive diction does not exclude what enters into
 the concept of the term to which it is adjoined, if they do not
 differ in suppositum, as part and universal. But the Son differs in
 suppositum from the Father; and so there is no parity.
"," We do not say absolutely that the Son alone is Most
 High; but that He alone is Most High ""with the Holy Ghost, in the
 glory of God the Father.""
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
180,"[I, Q. 32, Art. 1]
","Whether the Trinity of the Divine Persons Can Be Known by Natural
"," It would seem that the trinity of the divine persons can
 be known by natural reason. For philosophers came to the knowledge of
 God not otherwise than by natural reason. Now we find that they said
 many things about the trinity of persons, for Aristotle says (De Coelo
 et Mundo i, 2): ""Through this number""--namely, three--""we bring
 ourselves to acknowledge the greatness of one God, surpassing all
 things created."" And Augustine says (Confess. vii, 9): ""I have read in
 their works, not in so many words, but enforced by many and various
 reasons, that in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with
 God, and the Word was God,"" and so on; in which passage the
 distinction of persons is laid down. We read, moreover, in a gloss on
 Rom. 1 and Ex. 8 that the magicians of Pharaoh failed in the third
 sign--that is, as regards knowledge of a third person--i.e. of the
 Holy Ghost--and thus it is clear that they knew at least two
 persons. Likewise Trismegistus says: ""The monad begot a monad, and
 reflected upon itself its own heat."" By which words the generation of
 the Son and procession of the Holy Ghost seem to be indicated.
 Therefore knowledge of the divine persons can be obtained by natural
 reason.
"," Further, Richard St. Victor says (De Trin. i, 4): ""I believe
 without doubt that probable and even necessary arguments can be found
 for any explanation of the truth."" So even to prove the Trinity some
 have brought forward a reason from the infinite goodness of God, who
 communicates Himself infinitely in the procession of the divine
 persons; while some are moved by the consideration that ""no good
 thing can be joyfully possessed without partnership."" Augustine
 proceeds (De Trin. x, 4; x, 11, 12) to prove the trinity of persons
 by the procession of the word and of love in our own mind; and we
 have followed him in this (Q. 27, AA. 1, 3). Therefore the trinity of
 persons can be known by natural reason.
"," Further, it seems to be superfluous to teach what cannot be
 known by natural reason. But it ought not to be said that the divine
 tradition of the Trinity is superfluous. Therefore the trinity of
 persons can be known by natural reason.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The philosophers did not know the mystery of the
 trinity of the divine persons by its proper attributes, such as
 paternity, filiation, and procession, according to the Apostle's
 words, ""We speak the wisdom of God which none of the princes of the
 world""--i.e. the philosophers--""knew"" (1 Cor. 2:6). Nevertheless,
 they knew some of the essential attributes appropriated to the
 persons, as power to the Father, wisdom to the Son, goodness to the
 Holy Ghost; as will later on appear. So, when Aristotle said, ""By this
 number,"" etc., we must not take it as if he affirmed a threefold
 number in God, but that he wished to say that the ancients used the
 threefold number in their sacrifices and prayers on account of some
 perfection residing in the number three. In the Platonic books also
 we find, ""In the beginning was the word,"" not as meaning the Person
 begotten in God, but as meaning the ideal type whereby God made all
 things, and which is appropriated to the Son. And although they knew
 these were appropriated to the three persons, yet they are said to
 have failed in the third sign--that is, in the knowledge of the third
 person, because they deviated from the goodness appropriated to the
 Holy Ghost, in that knowing God ""they did not glorify Him as God""
 (Rom. 1); or, because the Platonists asserted the existence of one
 Primal Being whom they also declared to be the father of the universe,
 they consequently maintained the existence of another substance
 beneath him, which they called ""mind"" or the ""paternal intellect,""
 containing the idea of all things, as Macrobius relates (Som. Scip.
 iv). They did not, however, assert the existence of a third separate
 substance which might correspond to the Holy Ghost. So also we do not
 assert that the Father and the Son differ in substance, which was the
 error of Origen and Arius, who in this followed the Platonists. When
 Trismegistus says, ""Monad begot monad,"" etc., this does not refer to
 the generation of the Son, or to the procession of the Holy Ghost, but
 to the production of the world. For one God produced one world by
 reason of His love for Himself.
"," Reason may be employed in two ways to establish a
 point: firstly, for the purpose of furnishing sufficient proof of
 some principle, as in natural science, where sufficient proof can be
 brought to show that the movement of the heavens is always of uniform
 velocity. Reason is employed in another way, not as furnishing a
 sufficient proof of a principle, but as confirming an already
 established principle, by showing the congruity of its results, as in
 astrology the theory of eccentrics and epicycles is considered as
 established, because thereby the sensible appearances of the heavenly
 movements can be explained; not, however, as if this proof were
 sufficient, forasmuch as some other theory might explain them. In the
 first way, we can prove that God is one; and the like. In the second
 way, reasons avail to prove the Trinity; as, when assumed to be true,
 such reasons confirm it. We must not, however, think that the trinity
 of persons is adequately proved by such reasons. This becomes evident
 when we consider each point; for the infinite goodness of God is
 manifested also in creation, because to produce from nothing is an
 act of infinite power. For if God communicates Himself by His
 infinite goodness, it is not necessary that an infinite effect should
 proceed from God: but that according to its own mode and capacity it
 should receive the divine goodness. Likewise, when it is said that
 joyous possession of good requires partnership, this holds in the
 case of one not having perfect goodness: hence it needs to share some
 other's good, in order to have the goodness of complete happiness.
 Nor is the image in our mind an adequate proof in the case of God,
 forasmuch as the intellect is not in God and ourselves univocally.
 Hence, Augustine says (Tract. xxvii. in Joan.) that by faith we
 arrive at knowledge, and not conversely.
"," There are two reasons why the knowledge of the divine
 persons was necessary for us. It was necessary for the right idea of
 creation. The fact of saying that God made all things by His Word
 excludes the error of those who say that God produced things by
 necessity. When we say that in Him there is a procession of love, we
 show that God produced creatures not because He needed them, nor
 because of any other extrinsic reason, but on account of the love of
 His own goodness. So Moses, when he had said, ""In the beginning God
 created heaven and earth,"" subjoined, ""God said, Let there be light,""
 to manifest the divine Word; and then said, ""God saw the light that
 it was good,"" to show proof of the divine love. The same is also
 found in the other works of creation. In another way, and chiefly,
 that we may think rightly concerning the salvation of the human race,
 accomplished by the Incarnate Son, and by the gift of the Holy Ghost.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
181,"[I, Q. 32, Art. 2]
","Whether There Are Notions in God?
"," It would seem that in God there are no notions. For
 Dionysius says (Div. Nom. i): ""We must not dare to say anything of God
 but what is taught to us by the Holy Scripture."" But Holy Scripture
 does not say anything concerning notions. Therefore there are none in
 God.
"," Further, all that exists in God concerns the unity of the
 essence or the trinity of the persons. But the notions do not concern
 the unity of the essence, nor the trinity of the persons; for neither
 can what belongs to the essence be predicated of the notions: for
 instance, we do not say that paternity is wise or creates; nor can
 what belongs to the persons be so predicated; for example, we do not
 say that paternity begets, nor that filiation is begotten. Therefore
 there do not exist notions in God.
"," Further, we do not require to presuppose any abstract notions
 as principles of knowing things which are devoid of composition: for
 they are known of themselves. But the divine persons are supremely
 simple. Therefore we are not to suppose any notions in God.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Although the notions are not mentioned in Holy
 Scripture, yet the persons are mentioned, comprising the idea of
 notions, as the abstract is contained in the concrete.
"," In God the notions have their significance not after
 the manner of realities, but by way of certain ideas whereby the
 persons are known; although in God these notions or relations are
 real, as stated above (Q. 28, A. 1). Therefore whatever has order to
 any essential or personal act, cannot be applied to the notions;
 forasmuch as this is against their mode of signification. Hence we
 cannot say that paternity begets, or creates, or is wise, or is
 intelligent. The essentials, however, which are not ordered to any
 act, but simply remove created conditions from God, can be predicated
 of the notions; for we can say that paternity is eternal, or immense,
 or such like. So also on account of the real identity, substantive
 terms, whether personal or essential, can be predicated of the
 notions; for we can say that paternity is God, and that paternity is
 the Father.
"," Although the persons are simple, still without
 prejudice to their simplicity, the proper ideas of the persons can be
 abstractedly signified, as above explained.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
182,"[I, Q. 32, Art. 3]
","Whether There Are Five Notions?
"," It would seem that there are not five notions. For the
 notions proper to the persons are the relations whereby they are
 distinguished from each other. But the relations in God are only four
 (Q. 28, A. 4). Therefore the notions are only four in number.
"," Further, as there is only one essence in God, He is called
 one God, and because in Him there are three persons, He is called the
 Trine God. Therefore, if in God there are five notions, He may be
 called quinary; which cannot be allowed.
"," Further, if there are five notions for the three persons in
 God, there must be in some one person two or more notions, as in the
 person of the Father there is innascibility and paternity, and common
 spiration. Either these three notions really differ, or not. If they
 really differ, it follows that the person of the Father is composed
 of several things. But if they differ only logically, it follows that
 one of them can be predicated of another, so that we can say that as
 the divine goodness is the same as the divine wisdom by reason of the
 common reality, so common spiration is paternity; which is not to be
 admitted. Therefore there are not five notions.
"," On the contrary, It seems that there are more; because as
 the Father is from no one, and therefrom is derived the notion of
 innascibility; so from the Holy Ghost no other person proceeds. And
 in this respect there ought to be a sixth notion.
"," Further, as the Father and the Son are the common origin of
 the Holy Ghost, so it is common to the Son and the Holy Ghost to
 proceed from the Father. Therefore, as one notion is common to the
 Father and the Son, so there ought to be one notion common to the Son
 and to the Holy Ghost.
",,,,,,,,,,,,," Besides the four relations, another notion must be
 admitted, as above explained.
"," The divine essence is signified as a reality; and
 likewise the persons are signified as realities; whereas the notions
 are signified as ideas notifying the persons. Therefore, although God
 is one by unity of essence, and trine by trinity of persons,
 nevertheless He is not quinary by the five notions.
"," Since the real plurality in God is founded only on
 relative opposition, the several properties of one Person, as they
 are not relatively opposed to each other, do not really differ. Nor
 again are they predicated of each other, because they are different
 ideas of the persons; as we do not say that the attribute of power is
 the attribute of knowledge, although we do say that knowledge is
 power.
"," Since Person implies dignity, as stated above (Q. 19,
 A. 3), we cannot derive a notion of the Holy Spirit from the fact
 that no person is from Him. For this does not belong to His dignity,
 as it belongs to the authority of the Father that He is from no one.
"," The Son and the Holy Ghost do not agree in one special
 mode of existence derived from the Father; as the Father and the Son
 agree in one special mode of producing the Holy Ghost. But the
 principle on which a notion is based must be something special; thus
 no parity of reasoning exists.
",,,,,,,,,,,
183,"[I, Q. 32, Art. 4]
","Whether It Is Lawful to Have Various Contrary Opinions of Notions?
"," It would seem that it is not lawful to have various
 contrary opinions of the notions. For Augustine says (De Trin. i, 3):
 ""No error is more dangerous than any as regards the Trinity"": to which
 mystery the notions assuredly belong. But contrary opinions must be in
 some way erroneous. Therefore it is not right to have contrary
 opinions of the notions.
"," Further, the persons are known by the notions. But no
 contrary opinion concerning the persons is to be tolerated. Therefore
 neither can there be about the notions.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
184,"[I, Q. 33, Art. 1]
","Whether It Belongs to the Father to Be the Principle?
"," It would seem that the Father cannot be called the
 principle of the Son, or of the Holy Ghost. For principle and cause
 are the same, according to the Philosopher (Metaph. iv). But we do not
 say that the Father is the cause of the Son. Therefore we must not say
 that He is the principle of the Son.
"," Further, a principle is so called in relation to the thing
 principled. So if the Father is the principle of the Son, it follows
 that the Son is a person principled, and is therefore created; which
 appears false.
"," Further, the word principle is taken from priority. But in
 God there is no ""before"" and ""after,"" as Athanasius says. Therefore
 in speaking of God we ought not to used the term principle.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The Greeks use the words ""cause"" and ""principle""
 indifferently, when speaking of God; whereas the Latin Doctors do not
 use the word ""cause,"" but only ""principle."" The reason is because
 ""principle"" is a wider term than ""cause""; as ""cause"" is more common
 than ""element."" For the first term of a thing, as also the first
 part, is called the principle, but not the cause. Now the wider a
 term is, the more suitable it is to use as regards God (Q. 13, A.
 11), because the more special terms are, the more they determine the
 mode adapted to the creature. Hence this term ""cause"" seems to mean
 diversity of substance, and dependence of one from another; which is
 not implied in the word ""principle."" For in all kinds of causes there
 is always to be found between the cause and the effect a distance of
 perfection or of power: whereas we use the term ""principle"" even in
 things which have no such difference, but have only a certain order
 to each other; as when we say that a point is the principle of a
 line; or also when we say that the first part of a line is the
 principle of a line.
"," It is the custom with the Greeks to say that the Son
 and the Holy Ghost are principled. This is not, however, the custom
 with our Doctors; because, although we attribute to the Father
 something of authority by reason of His being the principle, still we
 do not attribute any kind of subjection or inferiority to the Son, or
 to the Holy Ghost, to avoid any occasion of error. In this way,
 Hilary says (De Trin. ix): ""By authority of the Giver, the Father is
 the greater; nevertheless the Son is not less to Whom oneness of
 nature is give.""
"," Although this word principle, as regards its
 derivation, seems to be taken from priority, still it does not
 signify priority, but origin. For what a term signifies, and the
 reason why it was imposed, are not the same thing, as stated above
 (Q. 13, A. 8).
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
185,"[I, Q. 33, Art. 2]
","Whether This Name ""Father"" Is Properly the Name of a Divine Person?
"," It would seem that this name ""Father"" is not properly
 the name of a divine person. For the name ""Father"" signifies
 relation. Moreover ""person"" is an individual substance. Therefore
 this name ""Father"" is not properly a name signifying a Person.
"," Further, a begetter is more common than father; for every
 father begets; but it is not so conversely. But a more common term is
 more properly applied to God, as stated above (Q. 13, A. 11).
 Therefore the more proper name of the divine person is begetter and
 genitor than Father.
"," Further, a metaphorical term cannot be the proper name of
 anyone. But the word is by us metaphorically called begotten, or
 offspring; and consequently, he of whom is the word, is
 metaphorically called father. Therefore the principle of the Word in
 God is not properly called Father.
"," Further, everything which is said properly of God, is said of
 God first before creatures. But generation appears to apply to
 creatures before God; because generation seems to be truer when the
 one who proceeds is distinct from the one whence it proceeds, not
 only by relation but also by essence. Therefore the name ""Father""
 taken from generation does not seem to be the proper name of any
 divine person.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," Among us relation is not a subsisting person. So this
 name ""father"" among us does not signify a person, but the relation of
 a person. In God, however, it is not so, as some wrongly thought; for
 in God the relation signified by the name ""Father"" is a subsisting
 person. Hence, as above explained (Q. 29, A. 4), this name ""person""
 in God signifies a relation subsisting in the divine nature.
"," According to the Philosopher (De Anima ii, text 49), a
 thing is denominated chiefly by its perfection, and by its end. Now
 generation signifies something in process of being made, whereas
 paternity signifies the complement of generation; and therefore the
 name ""Father"" is more expressive as regards the divine person than
 genitor or begettor.
"," In human nature the word is not a subsistence, and
 hence is not properly called begotten or son. But the divine Word is
 something subsistent in the divine nature; and hence He is properly
 and not metaphorically called Son, and His principle is called Father.
"," The terms ""generation"" and ""paternity"" like the other
 terms properly applied to God, are said of God before creatures as
 regards the thing signified, but not as regards the mode of
 signification. Hence also the Apostle says, ""I bend my knee to the
 Father of my Lord Jesus Christ, from whom all paternity in heaven and
 on earth is named"" (Eph. 3:14). This is explained thus. It is
 manifest that generation receives its species from the term which is
 the form of the thing generated; and the nearer it is to the form of
 the generator, the truer and more perfect is the generation; as
 univocal generation is more perfect than non-univocal, for it belongs
 to the essence of a generator to generate what is like itself in
 form. Hence the very fact that in the divine generation the form of
 the Begetter and Begotten is numerically the same, whereas in
 creatures it is not numerically, but only specifically, the same,
 shows that generation, and consequently paternity, is applied to God
 before creatures. Hence the very fact that in God a distinction
 exists of the Begotten from the Begetter as regards relation only,
 belongs to the truth of the divine generation and paternity.
",,,,,,,,,,,,
186,"[I, Q. 33, Art. 3]
","Whether This Name ""Father"" Is Applied to God, Firstly As a Personal
"," It would seem that this name ""Father"" is not applied to
 God, firstly as a personal name. For in the intellect the common
 precedes the particular. But this name ""Father"" as a personal name,
 belongs to the person of the Father; and taken in an essential sense
 it is common to the whole Trinity; for we say ""Our Father"" to the
 whole Trinity. Therefore ""Father"" comes first as an essential name
 before its personal sense.
"," Further, in things of which the concept is the same there is
 no priority of predication. But paternity and filiation seem to be of
 the same nature, according as a divine person is Father of the Son,
 and the whole Trinity is our Father, or the creature's; since,
 according to Basil (Hom. xv, De Fide), to receive is common to the
 creature and to the Son. Therefore ""Father"" in God is not taken as an
 essential name before it is taken personally.
"," Further, it is not possible to compare things which have not
 a common concept. But the Son is compared to the creature by reason
 of filiation or generation, according to Col. 1:15: ""Who is the image
 of the invisible God, the first-born of every creature."" Therefore
 paternity taken in a personal sense is not prior to, but has the same
 concept as, paternity taken essentially.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Common terms taken absolutely, in the order of our
 intelligence, come before proper terms; because they are included in
 the understanding of proper terms; but not conversely. For in the
 concept of the person of the Father, God is understood; but not
 conversely. But common terms which import relation to the creature
 come after proper terms which import personal relations; because the
 person proceeding in God proceeds as the principle of the production
 of creatures. For as the word conceived in the mind of the artist is
 first understood to proceed from the artist before the thing
 designed, which is produced in likeness to the word conceived in the
 artist's mind; so the Son proceeds from the Father before the
 creature, to which the name of filiation is applied as it
 participates in the likeness of the Son, as is clear from the words
 of Rom. 8:29: ""Whom He foreknew and predestined to be made
 conformable to the image of His Son.""
"," To ""receive"" is said to be common to the creature and
 to the Son not in a univocal sense, but according to a certain remote
 similitude whereby He is called the First Born of creatures. Hence
 the authority quoted subjoins: ""That He may be the First Born among
 many brethren,"" after saying that some were conformed to the image of
 the Son of God. But the Son of God possesses a position of
 singularity above others, in having by nature what He receives, as
 Basil also declares (Hom. xv De Fide); hence He is called the only
 begotten (John 1:18): ""The only begotten Who is in the bosom of the
 Father, He hath declared unto us.""
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
187,"[I, Q. 33, Art. 4]
","Whether It Is Proper to the Father to Be Unbegotten?
"," It would seem that it is not proper to the Father to be
 unbegotten. For every property supposes something in that of which it
 is the property. But ""unbegotten"" supposes nothing in the Father; it
 only removes something. Therefore it does not signify a property of
 the Father.
"," Further, Unbegotten is taken either in a privative, or in
 a negative sense. If in a negative sense, then whatever is not
 begotten can be called unbegotten. But the Holy Ghost is not begotten;
 neither is the divine essence. Therefore to be unbegotten belongs also
 to the essence; thus it is not proper to the Father. But if it be
 taken in a privative sense, as every privation signifies imperfection
 in the thing which is the subject of privation, it follows that the
 Person of the Father is imperfect; which cannot be.
"," Further, in God, ""unbegotten"" does not signify relation,
 for it is not used relatively. Therefore it signifies substance;
 therefore unbegotten and begotten differ in substance. But the Son,
 Who is begotten, does not differ from the Father in substance.
 Therefore the Father ought not to be called unbegotten.
"," Further, property means what belongs to one alone. Since,
 then, there are more than one in God proceeding from another, there
 is nothing to prevent several not receiving their being from another.
 Therefore the Father is not alone unbegotten.
"," Further, as the Father is the principle of the person
 begotten, so is He of the person proceeding. So if by reason of his
 opposition to the person begotten, it is proper to the Father to be
 unbegotten it follows that it is proper to Him also to be
 unproceeding.
",,,,,,,,,,,,," Some there are who say that innascibility, signified by
 the word ""unbegotten,"" as a property of the Father, is not a negative
 term only, but either that it means both these things
 together--namely, that the Father is from no one, and that He is the
 principle of others; or that it imports universal authority, or also
 His plenitude as the source of all. This, however, does not seem
 true, because thus innascibility would not be a property distinct
 from paternity and spiration; but would include them as the proper is
 included in the common. For source and authority signify in God
 nothing but the principle of origin. We must therefore say with
 Augustine (De Trin. v, 7) that ""unbegotten"" imports the negation of
 passive generation. For he says that ""unbegotten"" has the same
 meaning as ""not a son."" Nor does it follow that ""unbegotten"" is not
 the proper notion of the Father; for primary and simple things are
 notified by negations; as, for instance, a point is defined as what
 has no part.
"," ""Unbegotten"" is taken sometimes in a negative sense
 only, and in that sense Jerome says that ""the Holy Ghost is
 unbegotten,"" that is, He is not begotten. Otherwise ""unbegotten"" may
 be taken in a kind of privative sense, but not as implying any
 imperfection. For privation can be taken in many ways; in one way
 when a thing has not what is naturally belongs to another, even
 though it is not of its own nature to have it; as, for instance, if a
 stone be called a dead thing, as wanting life, which naturally
 belongs to some other things. In another sense, privation is so
 called when something has not what naturally belongs to some members
 of its genus; as for instance when a mole is called blind. In a third
 sense privation means the absence of what something ought to have; in
 which sense, privation imports an imperfection. In this sense,
 ""unbegotten"" is not attributed to the Father as a privation, but it
 may be so attributed in the second sense, meaning that a certain
 person of the divine nature is not begotten, while some person of the
 same nature is begotten. In this sense the term ""unbegotten"" can be
 applied also to the Holy Ghost. Hence to consider it as a term proper
 to the Father alone, it must be further understood that the name
 ""unbegotten"" belongs to a divine person as the principle of another
 person; so that it be understood to imply negation in the genus of
 principle taken personally in God. Or that there be understood in the
 term ""unbegotten"" that He is not in any way derived from another; and
 not only that He is not from another by way only of generation. In
 this sense the term ""unbegotten"" does not belong at all to the Holy
 Ghost, Who is from another by procession, as a subsisting person; nor
 does it belong to the divine essence, of which it may be said that it
 is in the Son or in the Holy Ghost from another--namely, from the
 Father.
"," According to Damascene (De Fide Orth. ii, 9),
 ""unbegotten"" in one sense signifies the same as ""uncreated""; and thus
 it applies to the substance, for thereby does the created substance
 differ from the uncreated. In another sense it signifies what is not
 begotten, and in this sense it is a relative term; just as negation
 is reduced to the genus of affirmation, as ""not man"" is reduced to
 the genus of substance, and ""not white"" to the genus of quality.
 Hence, since ""begotten"" implies relation in God, ""unbegotten"" belongs
 also to relation. Thus it does not follow that the Father unbegotten
 is substantially distinguished from the Son begotten; but only by
 relation; that is, as the relation of Son is denied of the Father.
"," In every genus there must be something first; so in the
 divine nature there must be some one principle which is not from
 another, and which we call ""unbegotten."" To admit two innascibles is
 to suppose the existence of two Gods, and two divine natures. Hence
 Hilary says (De Synod.): ""As there is one God, so there cannot be two
 innascibles."" And this especially because, did two innascibles exist,
 one would not be from the other, and they would not be distinguished
 by relative opposition: therefore they would be distinguished from
 each other by diversity of nature.
"," The property of the Father, whereby He is not from
 another, is more clearly signified by the removal of the nativity of
 the Son, than by the removal of the procession of the Holy Ghost;
 both because the procession of the Holy Ghost has no special name, as
 stated above (Q. 27, A. 4, ad 3), and because also in the order of
 nature it presupposes the generation of the Son. Hence, it being
 denied of the Father that He is begotten, although He is the
 principle of generation, it follows, as a consequence, that He does
 not proceed by the procession of the Holy Ghost, because the Holy
 Ghost is not the principle of generation, but proceeds from the
 person begotten.

188,"[I, Q. 34, Art. 1]
","Whether Word in God Is a Personal Name?
"," It would seem that Word in God is not a personal name.
 For personal names are applied to God in a proper sense, as Father and
 Son. But Word is applied to God metaphorically, as Origen says on
 (John 1:1), ""In the beginning was the Word."" Therefore Word is not a
 personal name in God.
"," Further, according to Augustine (De Trin. ix, 10), ""The Word
 is knowledge with love;"" and according to Anselm (Monol. lx), ""To
 speak is to the Supreme Spirit nothing but to see by thought."" But
 knowledge and thought, and sight, are essential terms in God.
 Therefore Word is not a personal term in God.
"," Further, it is essential to word to be spoken. But, according
 to Anselm (Monol. lix), as the Father is intelligent, the Son is
 intelligent, and the Holy Ghost is intelligent, so the Father speaks,
 the Son speaks, and the Holy Ghost speaks; and likewise, each one of
 them is spoken. Therefore, the name Word is used as an essential term
 in God, and not in a personal sense.
"," Further, no divine person is made. But the Word of God is
 something made. For it is said, ""Fire, hail, snow, ice, the storms
 which do His Word"" (Ps. 148:8). Therefore the Word is not a personal
 name in God.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," The Arians, who sprang from Origen, declared that the
 Son differed in substance from the Father. Hence, they endeavored to
 maintain that when the Son of God is called the Word, this is not to
 be understood in a strict sense; lest the idea of the Word proceeding
 should compel them to confess that the Son of God is of the same
 substance as the Father. For the interior word proceeds in such a
 manner from the one who pronounces it, as to remain within him. But
 supposing Word to be said metaphorically of God, we must still admit
 Word in its strict sense. For if a thing be called a word
 metaphorically, this can only be by reason of some manifestation;
 either it makes something manifest as a word, or it is manifested by
 a word. If manifested by a word, there must exist a word whereby it
 is manifested. If it is called a word because it exteriorly
 manifests, what it exteriorly manifests cannot be called word except
 in as far as it signifies the interior concept of the mind, which
 anyone may also manifest by exterior signs. Therefore, although Word
 may be sometimes said of God metaphorically, nevertheless we must
 also admit Word in the proper sense, and which is said personally.
"," Nothing belonging to the intellect can be applied to
 God personally, except word alone; for word alone signifies that
 which emanates from another. For what the intellect forms in its
 conception is the word. Now, the intellect itself, according as it is
 made actual by the intelligible species, is considered absolutely;
 likewise the act of understanding which is to the actual intellect
 what existence is to actual being; since the act of understanding
 does not signify an act going out from the intelligent agent, but an
 act remaining in the agent. Therefore when we say that word is
 knowledge, the term knowledge does not mean the act of a knowing
 intellect, or any one of its habits, but stands for what the
 intellect conceives by knowing. Hence also Augustine says (De Trin.
 vii, 1) that the Word is ""begotten wisdom;"" for it is nothing but the
 concept of the Wise One; and in the same way It can be called
 ""begotten knowledge."" Thus can also be explained how ""to speak"" is in
 God ""to see by thought,"" forasmuch as the Word is conceived by the
 gaze of the divine thought. Still the term ""thought"" does not
 properly apply to the Word of God. For Augustine says (De Trin. xv,
 16): ""Therefore do we speak of the Word of God, and not of the
 Thought of God, lest we believe that in God there is something
 unstable, now assuming the form of Word, now putting off that form
 and remaining latent and as it were formless."" For thought consists
 properly in the search after the truth, and this has no place in God.
 But when the intellect attains to the form of truth, it does not
 think, but perfectly contemplates the truth. Hence Anselm (Monol. lx)
 takes ""thought"" in an improper sense for ""contemplation.""
"," As, properly speaking, Word in God is said personally,
 and not essentially, so likewise is to ""speak."" Hence, as the Word is
 not common to the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, so it is not true that
 the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are one speaker. So Augustine says
 (De Trin. vii, 1): ""He who speaks in that co-eternal Word is
 understood as not alone in God, but as being with that very Word,
 without which, forsooth, He would not be speaking."" On the other
 hand, ""to be spoken"" belongs to each Person, for not only is the word
 spoken, but also the thing understood or signified by the word.
 Therefore in this manner to one person alone in God does it belong to
 be spoken in the same way as a word is spoken; whereas in the way
 whereby a thing is spoken as being understood in the word, it belongs
 to each Person to be spoken. For the Father, by understanding
 Himself, the Son and the Holy Ghost, and all other things comprised
 in this knowledge, conceives the Word; so that thus the whole Trinity
 is ""spoken"" in the Word; and likewise also all creatures: as the
 intellect of a man by the word he conceives in the act of
 understanding a stone, speaks a stone. Anselm took the term ""speak""
 improperly for the act of understanding; whereas they really differ
 from each other; for ""to understand"" means only the habitude of the
 intelligent agent to the thing understood, in which habitude no trace
 of origin is conveyed, but only a certain information of our
 intellect; forasmuch as our intellect is made actual by the form of
 the thing understood. In God, however, it means complete identity,
 because in God the intellect and the thing understood are altogether
 the same, as was proved above (Q. 14, AA. 4, 5). Whereas to ""speak""
 means chiefly the habitude to the word conceived; for ""to speak"" is
 nothing but to utter a word. But by means of the word it imports a
 habitude to the thing understood which in the word uttered is
 manifested to the one who understands. Thus, only the Person who
 utters the Word is ""speaker"" in God, although each Person understands
 and is understood, and consequently is spoken by the Word.
"," The term ""word"" is there taken figuratively, as the
 thing signified or effected by word is called word. For thus
 creatures are said to do the word of God, as executing any effect,
 whereto they are ordained from the word conceived of the divine
 wisdom; as anyone is said to do the word of the king when he does the
 work to which he is appointed by the king's word.
",,,,,,,,,,,,
189,"[I, Q. 34, Art. 2]
","Whether ""Word"" Is the Son's Proper Name?
"," It would seem that ""Word"" is not the proper name of the
 Son. For the Son is a subsisting person in God. But word does not
 signify a subsisting thing, as appears in ourselves. Therefore word
 cannot be the proper name of the person of the Son.
"," Further, the word proceeds from the speaker by being uttered.
 Therefore if the Son is properly the word, He proceeds from the
 Father, by way only of utterance; which is the heresy of Valentine;
 as appears from Augustine (De Haeres. xi).
"," Further, every proper name of a person signifies some
 property of that person. Therefore, if the Word is the Son's proper
 name, it signifies some property of His; and thus there will be
 several more properties in God than those above mentioned.
"," Further, whoever understands conceives a word in the act of
 understanding. But the Son understands. Therefore some word belongs
 to the Son; and consequently to be Word is not proper to the Son.
"," Further, it is said of the Son (Heb. 1:3): ""Bearing all
 things by the word of His power;"" whence Basil infers (Cont. Eunom.
 v, 11) that the Holy Ghost is the Son's Word. Therefore to be Word is
 not proper to the Son.
",,,,,,,,,,,,," ""To be"" and ""to understand"" are not the same in us.
 Hence that which in us has intellectual being, does not belong to our
 nature. But in God ""to be"" and ""to understand"" are one and the same:
 hence the Word of God is not an accident in Him, or an effect of His;
 but belongs to His very nature. And therefore it must needs be
 something subsistent; for whatever is in the nature of God subsists;
 and so Damascene says (De Fide Orth. i, 18) that ""the Word of God is
 substantial and has a hypostatic being; but other words [as our own]
 are activities if the soul.""
"," The error of Valentine was condemned, not as the Arians
 pretended, because he asserted that the Son was born by being
 uttered, as Hilary relates (De Trin. vi); but on account of the
 different mode of utterance proposed by its author, as appears from
 Augustine (De Haeres. xi).
"," In the term ""Word"" the same property is comprised as in
 the name Son. Hence Augustine says (De Trin. vii, 11): ""Word and Son
 express the same."" For the Son's nativity, which is His personal
 property, is signified by different names, which are attributed to
 the Son to express His perfection in various ways. To show that He is
 of the same nature as the Father, He is called the Son; to show that
 He is co-eternal, He is called the Splendor; to show that He is
 altogether like, He is called the Image; to show that He is begotten
 immaterially, He is called the Word. All these truths cannot be
 expressed by only one name.
"," To be intelligent belongs to the Son, in the same way
 as it belongs to Him to be God, since to understand is said of God
 essentially, as stated above (Q. 14, AA. 2, 4). Now the Son is God
 begotten, and not God begetting; and hence He is intelligent, not as
 producing a Word, but as the Word proceeding; forasmuch as in God the
 Word proceeding does not differ really from the divine intellect, but
 is distinguished from the principle of the Word only by relation.
"," When it is said of the Son, ""Bearing all things by the
 word of His power""; ""word"" is taken figuratively for the effect of
 the Word. Hence a gloss says that ""word"" is here taken to mean
 command; inasmuch as by the effect of the power of the Word, things
 are kept in being, as also by the effect of the power of the Word
 things are brought into being. Basil speaks widely and figuratively
 in applying Word to the Holy Ghost; in the sense perhaps that
 everything that makes a person known may be called his word, and so
 in that way the Holy Ghost may be called the Son's Word, because He
 manifests the Son.
",,,,,,,,,,,
190,"[I, Q. 34, Art. 3]
","Whether the Name ""Word"" Imports Relation to Creatures?
"," It would seem that the name 'Word' does not import
 relation to creatures. For every name that connotes some effect in
 creatures, is said of God essentially. But Word is not said
 essentially, but personally. Therefore Word does not import relation
 to creatures.
"," Further, whatever imports relation to creatures is said of
 God in time; as ""Lord"" and ""Creator."" But Word is said of God from
 eternity. Therefore it does not import relation to the creature.
"," Further, Word imports relation to the source whence it
 proceeds. Therefore, if it imports relation to the creature, it
 follows that the Word proceeds from the creature.
"," Further, ideas (in God) are many according to their various
 relations to creatures. Therefore if Word imports relation to
 creatures, it follows that in God there is not one Word only, but
 many.
"," Further, if Word imports relation to the creature, this can
 only be because creatures are known by God. But God does not know
 beings only; He knows also non-beings. Therefore in the Word are
 implied relations to non-beings; which appears to be false.
",,,,,,,,,,,,," The nature is also included indirectly in the name of
 the person; for person is an individual substance of a rational
 nature. Therefore the name of a divine person, as regards the
 personal relation, does not imply relation to the creature, but it is
 implied in what belongs to the nature. Yet there is nothing to
 prevent its implying relation to creatures, so far as the essence is
 included in its meaning: for as it properly belongs to the Son to be
 the Son, so it properly belongs to Him to be God begotten, or the
 Creator begotten; and in this way the name Word imports relation to
 creatures.
"," Since the relations result from actions, some names
 import the relation of God to creatures, which relation follows on
 the action of God which passes into some exterior effect, as to
 create and to govern; and the like are applied to God in time. But
 others import a relation which follows from an action which does not
 pass into an exterior effect, but abides in the agent--as to know and
 to will: such are not applied to God in time; and this kind of
 relation to creatures is implied in the name of the Word. Nor is it
 true that all names which import the relation of God to creatures are
 applied to Him in time; but only those names are applied in time
 which import relation following on the action of God passing into
 exterior effect.
"," Creatures are known to God not by a knowledge derived
 from the creatures themselves, but by His own essence. Hence it is
 not necessary that the Word should proceed from creatures, although
 the Word is expressive of creatures.
"," The name of Idea is imposed chiefly to signify relation
 to creatures; and therefore it is applied in a plural sense to God;
 and it is not said personally. But the name of Word is imposed
 chiefly to signify the speaker, and consequently, relation to
 creatures, inasmuch as God, by understanding Himself, understands
 every creature; and so there is only one Word in God, and that is a
 personal one.
"," God's knowledge of non-beings and God's Word about
 non-beings are the same; because the Word of God contains no less
 than does the knowledge of God, as Augustine says (De Trin. xv, 14).
 Nevertheless the Word is expressive and operative of beings, but is
 expressive and manifestive of non-beings.

191,"[I, Q. 35, Art. 1]
","Whether Image in God Is Said Personally?
"," It would seem that image is not said personally of God.
 For Augustine (Fulgentius, De Fide ad Petrum i) says, ""The Godhead
 of the Holy Trinity and the Image whereunto man is made are one.""
 Therefore Image is said of God essentially, and not personally.
"," Further, Hilary says (De Synod.): ""An image is a like
 species of that which it represents."" But species or form is said
 of God essentially. Therefore so also is Image.
"," Further, Image is derived from imitation, which implies
 ""before"" and ""after."" But in the divine persons there is no ""before""
 and ""after."" Therefore Image cannot be a personal name in God.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Image, properly speaking, means whatever proceeds forth
 in likeness to another. That to the likeness of which anything
 proceeds, is properly speaking called the exemplar, and is improperly
 called the image. Nevertheless Augustine (Fulgentius) uses the name
 of Image in this sense when he says that the divine nature of the
 Holy Trinity is the Image to whom man was made.
"," species, as mentioned by Hilary in the definition of
 image, means the form derived from one thing to another. In this
 sense image is said to be the species of anything, as that which is
 assimilated to anything is called its form, inasmuch as it has a like
 form.
"," Imitation in God does not signify posteriority, but
 only assimilation.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
192,"[I, Q. 35, Art. 2]
","Whether the Name of Image Is Proper to the Son?
"," It would seem that the name of Image is not proper to the
 Son; because, as Damascene says (De Fide Orth. i, 18), ""The Holy Ghost
 is the Image of the Son."" Therefore Image does not belong to the Son
 alone.
"," Further, similitude in expression belongs to the nature of an
 image, as Augustine says (QQ. lxxxiii, qu. 74). But this belongs to
 the Holy Ghost, Who proceeds from another by way of similitude.
 Therefore the Holy Ghost is an Image; and so to be Image does not
 belong to the Son alone.
"," Further, man is also called the image of God, according to 1
 Cor. 11:7, ""The man ought not to cover his head, for he is the image
 and the glory of God."" Therefore Image is not proper to the Son.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Damascene and the other Greek Doctors commonly employ
 the term image as meaning a perfect similitude.
"," Although the Holy Ghost is like to the Father and the
 Son, still it does not follow that He is the Image, as above
 explained.
"," The image of a thing may be found in something in two
 ways. In one way it is found in something of the same specific
 nature; as the image of the king is found in his son. In another way
 it is found in something of a different nature, as the king's image
 on the coin. In the first sense the Son is the Image of the Father;
 in the second sense man is called the image of God; and therefore in
 order to express the imperfect character of the divine image in man,
 man is not simply called the image, but ""to the image,"" whereby is
 expressed a certain movement of tendency to perfection. But it cannot
 be said that the Son of God is ""to the image,"" because He is the
 perfect Image of the Father.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
193,"[I, Q. 36, Art. 1]
","Whether This Name ""Holy Ghost"" Is the Proper Name of One Divine Person?
"," It would seem that this name, ""Holy Ghost,"" is not the
 proper name of one divine person. For no name which is common to the
 three persons is the proper name of any one person. But this name of
 'Holy Ghost' [*It should be borne in mind that the word ""ghost"" is the
 old English equivalent for the Latin ""spiritus,""] whether in the sense
 of ""breath"" or ""blast,"" or in the sense of ""spirit,"" as an immaterial
 substance. Thus, we read in the former sense (Hampole, Psalter x, 7),
 ""The Gost of Storms"" [spiritus procellarum], and in the latter
 ""Trubled gost is sacrifice of God"" (Prose Psalter, A.D. 1325), and
 ""Oure wrestlynge is . . . against the spiritual wicked gostes of the
 ayre"" (More, ""Comfort against Tribulation""); and in our modern
 expression of ""giving up the ghost."" As applied to God, and not
 specially to the third Holy Person, we have an example from Maunder,
 ""Jhesu Criste was the worde and the goste of Good."" (See Oxford
 Dictionary).) is common to the three persons; for Hilary (De Trin.
 viii) shows that the ""Spirit of God"" sometimes means the Father, as in
 the words of Isa. 61:1: ""The Spirit of the Lord is upon me;"" and
 sometimes the Son, as when the Son says: ""In the Spirit of God I cast
 out devils"" (Matt. 12:28), showing that He cast out devils by His own
 natural power; and that sometimes it means the Holy Ghost, as in the
 words of Joel 2:28: ""I will pour out of My Spirit over all flesh.""
 Therefore this name 'Holy Ghost' is not the proper name of a divine
 person.
"," Further, the names of the divine persons are relative terms,
 as Boethius says (De Trin.). But this name ""Holy Ghost"" is not a
 relative term. Therefore this name is not the proper name of a divine
 Person.
"," Further, because the Son is the name of a divine Person He
 cannot be called the Son of this or of that. But the spirit is spoken
 of as of this or that man, as appears in the words, ""The Lord said to
 Moses, I will take of thy spirit and will give to them"" (Num. 11:17)
 and also ""The Spirit of Elias rested upon Eliseus"" (4 Kings 2:15).
 Therefore ""Holy Ghost"" does not seem to be the proper name of a
 divine Person.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The expression Holy Spirit, if taken as two words, is
 applicable to the whole Trinity: because by 'spirit' the
 immateriality of the divine substance is signified; for corporeal
 spirit is invisible, and has but little matter; hence we apply this
 term to all immaterial and invisible substances. And by adding the
 word ""holy"" we signify the purity of divine goodness. But if Holy
 Spirit be taken as one word, it is thus that the expression, in the
 usage of the Church, is accommodated to signify one of the three
 persons, the one who proceeds by way of love, for the reason above
 explained.
"," Although this name ""Holy Ghost"" does not indicate a
 relation, still it takes the place of a relative term, inasmuch as it
 is accommodated to signify a Person distinct from the others by
 relation only. Yet this name may be understood as including a
 relation, if we understand the Holy Spirit as being breathed
 [spiratus].
"," In the name Son we understand that relation only which
 is of something from a principle, in regard to that principle: but in
 the name ""Father"" we understand the relation of principle; and
 likewise in the name of Spirit inasmuch as it implies a moving power.
 But to no creature does it belong to be a principle as regards a
 divine person; but rather the reverse. Therefore we can say ""our
 Father,"" and ""our Spirit""; but we cannot say ""our Son.""
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
194,"[I, Q. 36, Art. 2]
","Whether the Holy Ghost Proceeds from the Son?
"," It would seem that the Holy Ghost does not proceed from
 the Son. For as Dionysius says (Div. Nom. i): ""We must not dare to say
 anything concerning the substantial Divinity except what has been
 divinely expressed to us by the sacred oracles."" But in the Sacred
 Scripture we are not told that the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Son;
 but only that He proceeds from the Father, as appears from John 15:26:
 ""The Spirit of truth, Who proceeds from the Father."" Therefore the
 Holy Ghost does not proceed from the Son.
"," Further, In the creed of the council of Constantinople (Can.
 vii) we read: ""We believe in the Holy Ghost, the Lord and Life-giver,
 who proceeds from the Father; with the Father and the Son to be
 adored and glorified."" Therefore it should not be added in our Creed
 that the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Son; and those who added such a
 thing appear to be worthy of anathema.
"," Further, Damascene says (De Fide Orth. i): ""We say that the
 Holy Ghost is from the Father, and we name Him the spirit of the
 Father; but we do not say that the Holy Ghost is from the Son, yet we
 name Him the Spirit of the Son."" Therefore the Holy Ghost does not
 proceed from the Son.
"," Further, Nothing proceeds from that wherein it rests. But the
 Holy Ghost rests in the Son; for it is said in the legend of St.
 Andrew: ""Peace be to you and to all who believe in the one God the
 Father, and in His only Son our Lord Jesus Christ, and in the one
 Holy Ghost proceeding from the Father, and abiding in the Son.""
 Therefore the Holy Ghost does not proceed from the Son.
"," Further, the Son proceeds as the Word. But our breath
 [spiritus] does not seem to proceed in ourselves from our word.
 Therefore the Holy Ghost does not proceed from the Son.
"," Further, the Holy Ghost proceeds perfectly from the Father.
 Therefore it is superfluous to say that He proceeds from the Son.
"," Further ""the actual and the possible do not differ in things
 perpetual"" (Phys. iii, text 32), and much less so in God. But it is
 possible for the Holy Ghost to be distinguished from the Son, even if
 He did not proceed from Him. For Anselm says (De Process. Spir.
 Sancti, ii): ""The Son and the Holy Ghost have their Being from the
 Father; but each in a different way; one by Birth, the other by
 Procession, so that they are thus distinct from one another."" And
 further on he says: ""For even if for no other reason were the Son and
 the Holy Ghost distinct, this alone would suffice."" Therefore the
 Holy Spirit is distinct from the Son, without proceeding from Him.
",,,,,,,,,,," We ought not to say about God anything which is not
 found in Holy Scripture either explicitly or implicitly. But although
 we do not find it verbally expressed in Holy Scripture that the Holy
 Ghost proceeds from the Son, still we do find it in the sense of
 Scripture, especially where the Son says, speaking of the Holy Ghost,
 ""He will glorify Me, because He shall receive of Mine"" (John 16:14).
 It is also a rule of Holy Scripture that whatever is said of the
 Father, applies to the Son, although there be added an exclusive
 term; except only as regards what belongs to the opposite relations,
 whereby the Father and the Son are distinguished from each other. For
 when the Lord says, ""No one knoweth the Son, but the Father,"" the
 idea of the Son knowing Himself is not excluded. So therefore when we
 say that the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father, even though it be
 added that He proceeds from the Father alone, the Son would not
 thereby be at all excluded; because as regards being the principle of
 the Holy Ghost, the Father and the Son are not opposed to each other,
 but only as regards the fact that one is the Father, and the other is
 the Son.
"," In every council of the Church a symbol of faith has
 been drawn up to meet some prevalent error condemned in the council
 at that time. Hence subsequent councils are not to be described as
 making a new symbol of faith; but what was implicitly contained in
 the first symbol was explained by some addition directed against
 rising heresies. Hence in the decision of the council of Chalcedon it
 is declared that those who were congregated together in the council
 of Constantinople, handed down the doctrine about the Holy Ghost, not
 implying that there was anything wanting in the doctrine of their
 predecessors who had gathered together at Nicaea, but explaining what
 those fathers had understood of the matter. Therefore, because at the
 time of the ancient councils the error of those who said that the
 Holy Ghost did not proceed from the Son had not arisen, it was not
 necessary to make any explicit declaration on that point; whereas,
 later on, when certain errors rose up, another council [*Council of
 Rome, under Pope Damasus] assembled in the west, the matter was
 explicitly defined by the authority of the Roman Pontiff, by whose
 authority also the ancient councils were summoned and confirmed.
 Nevertheless the truth was contained implicitly in the belief that
 the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father.
"," The Nestorians were the first to introduce the error
 that the Holy Ghost did not proceed from the Son, as appears in a
 Nestorian creed condemned in the council of Ephesus. This error was
 embraced by Theodoric the Nestorian, and several others after him,
 among whom was also Damascene. Hence, in that point his opinion is
 not to be held. Although, too, it has been asserted by some that
 while Damascene did not confess that the Holy Ghost was from the Son,
 neither do those words of his express a denial thereof.
"," When the Holy Ghost is said to rest or abide in the
 Son, it does not mean that He does not proceed from Him; for the Son
 also is said to abide in the Father, although He proceeds from the
 Father. Also the Holy Ghost is said to rest in the Son as the love of
 the lover abides in the beloved; or in reference to the human nature
 of Christ, by reason of what is written: ""On whom thou shalt see the
 Spirit descending and remaining upon Him, He it is who baptizes"" (John
 1:33).
"," The Word in God is not taken after the similitude of
 the vocal word, whence the breath [spiritus] does not proceed; for it
 would then be only metaphorical; but after the similitude of the
 mental word, whence proceeds love.
"," For the reason that the Holy Ghost proceeds from the
 Father perfectly, not only is it not superfluous to say He proceeds
 from the Son, but rather it is absolutely necessary. Forasmuch as one
 power belongs to the Father and the Son; and because whatever is from
 the Father, must be from the Son unless it be opposed to the property
 of filiation; for the Son is not from Himself, although He is from
 the Father.
"," The Holy Ghost is distinguished from the Son, inasmuch
 as the origin of one is distinguished from the origin of the other;
 but the difference itself of origin comes from the fact that the Son
 is only from the Father, whereas the Holy Ghost is from the Father
 and the Son; for otherwise the processions would not be distinguished
 from each other, as explained above, and in Q. 27.

195,"[I, Q. 36, Art. 3]
","Whether the Holy Ghost Proceeds from the Father Through the Son?
"," It would seem that the Holy Ghost does not proceed from
 the Father through the Son. For whatever proceeds from one through
 another, does not proceed immediately. Therefore, if the Holy Ghost
 proceeds from the Father through the Son, He does not proceed
 immediately; which seems to be unfitting.
"," Further, if the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father through
 the Son, He does not proceed from the Son, except on account of the
 Father. But ""whatever causes a thing to be such is yet more so.""
 Therefore He proceeds more from the Father than from the Son.
"," Further, the Son has His being by generation. Therefore if
 the Holy Ghost is from the Father through the Son, it follows that
 the Son is first generated and afterwards the Holy Ghost proceeds;
 and thus the procession of the Holy Ghost is not eternal, which is
 heretical.
"," Further, when anyone acts through another, the same may be
 said conversely. For as we say that the king acts through the
 bailiff, so it can be said conversely that the bailiff acts through
 the king. But we can never say that the Son spirates the Holy Ghost
 through the Father. Therefore it can never be said that the Father
 spirates the Holy Ghost through the Son.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," In every action two things are to be considered, the
 suppositum acting, and the power whereby it acts; as, for instance,
 fire heats through heat. So if we consider in the Father and the Son
 the power whereby they spirate the Holy Ghost, there is no mean, for
 this is one and the same power. But if we consider the persons
 themselves spirating, then, as the Holy Ghost proceeds both from the
 Father and from the Son, the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father
 immediately, as from Him, and mediately, as from the Son; and thus He
 is said to proceed from the Father through the Son. So also did Abel
 proceed immediately from Adam, inasmuch as Adam was his father; and
 mediately, as Eve was his mother, who proceeded from Adam; although,
 indeed, this example of a material procession is inept to signify the
 immaterial procession of the divine persons.
"," If the Son received from the Father a numerically
 distinct power for the spiration of the Holy Ghost, it would follow
 that He would be a secondary and instrumental cause; and thus the
 Holy Ghost would proceed more from the Father than from the Son;
 whereas, on the contrary, the same spirative power belongs to the
 Father and to the Son; and therefore the Holy Ghost proceeds equally
 from both, although sometimes He is said to proceed principally or
 properly from the Father, because the Son has this power from the
 Father.
"," As the begetting of the Son is co-eternal with the
 begetter (and hence the Father does not exist before begetting the
 Son), so the procession of the Holy Ghost is co-eternal with His
 principle. Hence, the Son was not begotten before the Holy Ghost
 proceeded; but each of the operations is eternal.
"," When anyone is said to work through anything, the
 converse proposition is not always true. For we do not say that the
 mallet works through the carpenter; whereas we can say that the
 bailiff acts through the king, because it is the bailiff's place to
 act, since he is master of his own act, but it is not the mallet's
 place to act, but only to be made to act, and hence it is used only
 as an instrument. The bailiff is, however, said to act through the
 king, although this preposition ""through"" denotes a medium, for the
 more a suppositum is prior in action, so much the more is its power
 immediate as regards the effect, inasmuch as the power of the first
 cause joins the second cause to its effect. Hence also first
 principles are said to be immediate in the demonstrative sciences.
 Therefore, so far as the bailiff is a medium according to the order
 of the subject's acting, the king is said to work through the
 bailiff; but according to the order of powers, the bailiff is said to
 act through the king, forasmuch as the power of the king gives the
 bailiff's action its effect. Now there is no order of power between
 Father and Son, but only order of 'supposita'; and hence we say that
 the Father spirates through the Son; and not conversely.

196,"[I, Q. 36, Art. 4]
","Whether the Father and the Son Are One Principle of the Holy Ghost?
"," It would seem that the Father and the Son are not one
 principle of the Holy Ghost. For the Holy Ghost does not proceed from
 the Father and the Son as they are one; not as they are one in nature,
 for the Holy Ghost would in that way proceed from Himself, as He is
 one in nature with Them; nor again inasmuch as they are united in any
 one property, for it is clear that one property cannot belong to two
 subjects. Therefore the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father and the
 Son as distinct from one another. Therefore the Father and the Son are
 not one principle of the Holy Ghost.
"," Further, in this proposition ""the Father and the Son are one
 principle of the Holy Ghost,"" we do not designate personal unity,
 because in that case the Father and the Son would be one person; nor
 again do we designate the unity of property, because if one property
 were the reason of the Father and the Son being one principle of the
 Holy Ghost, similarly, on account of His two properties, the Father
 would be two principles of the Son and of the Holy Ghost, which
 cannot be admitted. Therefore the Father and the Son are not one
 principle of the Holy Ghost.
"," Further, the Son is not one with the Father more than is the
 Holy Ghost. But the Holy Ghost and the Father are not one principle
 as regards any other divine person. Therefore neither are the Father
 and the Son.
"," Further, if the Father and the Son are one principle of the
 Holy Ghost, this one is either the Father or it is not the Father.
 But we cannot assert either of these positions because if the one is
 the Father, it follows that the Son is the Father; and if the one is
 not the Father, it follows that the Father is not the Father.
 Therefore we cannot say that the Father and the Son are one principle
 of the Holy Ghost.
"," Further, if the Father and the Son are one principle of the
 Holy Ghost, it seems necessary to say, conversely, that the one
 principle of the Holy Ghost is the Father and the Son. But this seems
 to be false; for this word ""principle"" stands either for the person
 of the Father, or for the person of the Son; and in either sense it
 is false. Therefore this proposition also is false, that the Father
 and the Son are one principle of the Holy Ghost.
"," Further, unity in substance makes identity. So if the Father
 and the Son are the one principle of the Holy Ghost, it follows that
 they are the same principle; which is denied by many. Therefore we
 cannot grant that the Father and the Son are one principle of the
 Holy Ghost.
"," Further, the Father, Son and Holy Ghost are called one
 Creator, because they are the one principle of the creature. But the
 Father and the Son are not one, but two Spirators, as many assert;
 and this agrees also with what Hilary says (De Trin. ii) that ""the
 Holy Ghost is to be confessed as proceeding from Father and Son as
 authors."" Therefore the Father and the Son are not one principle of
 the Holy Ghost.
",,,,,,,,,,," If we consider the spirative power, the Holy Ghost
 proceeds from the Father and the Son as they are one in the spirative
 power, which in a certain way signifies the nature with the property,
 as we shall see later (ad 7). Nor is there any reason against one
 property being in two supposita that possess one common nature. But
 if we consider the supposita of the spiration, then we may say that
 the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father and the Son, as distinct; for
 He proceeds from them as the unitive love of both.
"," In the proposition ""the Father and the Son are one
 principle of the Holy Ghost,"" one property is designated which is the
 form signified by the term. It does not thence follow that by reason
 of the several properties the Father can be called several
 principles, for this would imply in Him a plurality of subjects.
"," It is not by reason of relative properties that we
 speak of similitude or dissimilitude in God, but by reason of the
 essence. Hence, as the Father is not more like to Himself than He is
 to the Son; so likewise neither is the Son more like to the Father
 than is the Holy Ghost.
"," These two propositions, ""The Father and the Son are one
 principle which is the Father,"" or, ""one principle which is not the
 Father,"" are not mutually contradictory; and hence it is not
 necessary to assert one or other of them. For when we say the Father
 and the Son are one principle, this word ""principle"" has not
 determinate supposition but rather it stands indeterminately for two
 persons together. Hence there is a fallacy of ""figure of speech"" as
 the argument concludes from the indeterminate to the determinate.
"," This proposition is also true:--The one principle of
 the Holy Ghost is the Father and the Son; because the word
 ""principle"" does not stand for one person only, but indistinctly for
 the two persons as above explained.
"," There is no reason against saying that the Father and
 the Son are the same principle, because the word ""principle"" stands
 confusedly and indistinctly for the two Persons together.
"," Some say that although the Father and the Son are one
 principle of the Holy Ghost, there are two spirators, by reason of
 the distinction of supposita, as also there are two spirating,
 because acts refer to subjects. Yet this does not hold good as to the
 name ""Creator""; because the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father and
 the Son as from two distinct persons, as above explained; whereas the
 creature proceeds from the three persons not as distinct persons, but
 as united in essence. It seems, however, better to say that because
 spirating is an adjective, and spirator a substantive, we can say
 that the Father and the Son are two spirating, by reason of the
 plurality of the supposita but not two spirators by reason of the
 one spiration. For adjectival words derive their number from the
 supposita but substantives from themselves, according to the form
 signified. As to what Hilary says, that ""the Holy Ghost is from the
 Father and the Son as His authors,"" this is to be explained in the
 sense that the substantive here stands for the adjective.

197,"[I, Q. 37, Art. 2]
","Whether ""Love"" Is the Proper Name of the Holy Ghost?
"," It would seem that ""Love"" is not the proper name of the
 Holy Ghost. For Augustine says (De Trin. xv, 17): ""As the Father, Son
 and Holy Ghost are called Wisdom, and are not three Wisdoms, but one;
 I know not why the Father, Son and Holy Ghost should not be called
 Charity, and all together one Charity."" But no name which is
 predicated in the singular of each person and of all together, is a
 proper name of a person. Therefore this name, ""Love,"" is not the
 proper name of the Holy Ghost.
"," Further, the Holy Ghost is a subsisting person, but love is
 not used to signify a subsisting person, but rather an action passing
 from the lover to the beloved. Therefore Love is not the proper name
 of the Holy Ghost.
"," Further, Love is the bond between lovers, for as Dionysius
 says (Div. Nom. iv): ""Love is a unitive force."" But a bond is a
 medium between what it joins together, not something proceeding from
 them. Therefore, since the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father and
 the Son, as was shown above (Q. 36, A. 2), it seems that He is not
 the Love or bond of the Father and the Son.
"," Further, Love belongs to every lover. But the Holy Ghost is a
 lover: therefore He has love. So if the Holy Ghost is Love, He must
 be love of love, and spirit from spirit; which is not admissible.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," Augustine is there speaking of charity as it means the
 divine essence, as was said above (here and Q. 24, A. 2, ad 4).
"," Although to understand, and to will, and to love
 signify actions passing on to their objects, nevertheless they are
 actions that remain in the agents, as stated above (Q. 14, A. 4),
 yet in such a way that in the agent itself they import a certain
 relation to their object. Hence, love also in ourselves is something
 that abides in the lover, and the word of the heart is something
 abiding in the speaker; yet with a relation to the thing expressed by
 word, or loved. But in God, in whom there is nothing accidental, there
 is more than this; because both Word and Love are subsistent.
 Therefore, when we say that the Holy Ghost is the Love of the Father
 for the Son, or for something else; we do not mean anything that
 passes into another, but only the relation of love to the beloved; as
 also in the Word is imported the relation of the Word to the thing
 expressed by the Word.
"," The Holy Ghost is said to be the bond of the Father and
 Son, inasmuch as He is Love; because, since the Father loves Himself
 and the Son with one Love, and conversely, there is expressed in the
 Holy Ghost, as Love, the relation of the Father to the Son, and
 conversely, as that of the lover to the beloved. But from the fact
 that the Father and the Son mutually love one another, it necessarily
 follows that this mutual Love, the Holy Ghost, proceeds from both. As
 regards origin, therefore, the Holy Ghost is not the medium, but the
 third person in the Trinity; whereas as regards the aforesaid
 relation He is the bond between the two persons, as proceeding from
 both.
"," As it does not belong to the Son, though He
 understands, to produce a word, for it belongs to Him to understand
 as the word proceeding; so in like manner, although the Holy Ghost
 loves, taking Love as an essential term, still it does not belong to
 Him to spirate love, which is to take love as a notional term;
 because He loves essentially as love proceeding; but not as the one
 whence love proceeds.
",,,,,,,,,,,,
198,"[I, Q. 37, Art. 2]
","Whether the Father and the Son Love Each Other by the Holy Ghost?
"," It would seem that the Father and the Son do not love
 each other by the Holy Ghost. For Augustine (De Trin. vii, 1) proves
 that the Father is not wise by the Wisdom begotten. But as the Son is
 Wisdom begotten, so the Holy Ghost is the Love proceeding, as
 explained above (Q. 27, A. 3). Therefore the Father and the Son do
 not love Themselves by the Love proceeding, which is the Holy Ghost.
"," Further, in the proposition, ""The Father and the Son love
 each other by the Holy Ghost,"" this word ""love"" is to be taken either
 essentially or notionally. But it cannot be true if taken
 essentially, because in the same way we might say that ""the Father
 understands by the Son""; nor, again, if it is taken notionally, for
 then, in like manner, it might be said that ""the Father and the Son
 spirate by the Holy Ghost,"" or that ""the Father generates by the
 Son."" Therefore in no way is this proposition true: ""The Father and
 the Son love each other by the Holy Ghost.""
"," Further, by the same love the Father loves the Son, and
 Himself, and us. But the Father does not love Himself by the Holy
 Ghost; for no notional act is reflected back on the principle of the
 act; since it cannot be said that the ""Father begets Himself,"" or
 that ""He spirates Himself."" Therefore, neither can it be said that
 ""He loves Himself by the Holy Ghost,"" if ""to love"" is taken in a
 notional sense. Again, the love wherewith He loves us is not the Holy
 Ghost; because it imports a relation to creatures, and this belongs
 to the essence. Therefore this also is false: ""The Father loves the
 Son by the Holy Ghost.""
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," To be wise or intelligent is taken only essentially in
 God; therefore we cannot say that ""the Father is wise or intelligent
 by the Son."" But to love is taken not only essentially, but also in a
 notional sense; and in this way, we can say that the Father and the
 Son love each other by the Holy Ghost, as was above explained.
"," When the idea of an action includes a determined
 effect, the principle of the action may be denominated both from the
 action, and from the effect; so we can say, for instance, that a tree
 flowers by its flowering and by its flower. When, however, the idea
 of an action does not include a determined effect, then in that case,
 the principle of the action cannot be denominated from the effect,
 but only from the action. For we do not say that the tree produces
 the flower by the flower, but by the production of the flower. So
 when we say, ""spirates"" or ""begets,"" this imports only a notional
 act. Hence we cannot say that the Father spirates by the Holy Ghost,
 or begets by the Son. But we can say that the Father speaks by the
 Word, as by the Person proceeding, ""and speaks by the speaking,"" as
 by a notional act; forasmuch as ""to speak"" imports a determinate
 person proceeding; since ""to speak"" means to produce a word. Likewise
 to love, taken in a notional sense, means to produce love; and so it
 can be said that the Father loves the Son by the Holy Ghost, as by
 the person proceeding, and by Love itself as a notional act.
"," The Father loves not only the Son, but also Himself and
 us, by the Holy Ghost; because, as above explained, to love, taken in
 a notional sense, not only imports the production of a divine person,
 but also the person produced, by way of love, which has relation to
 the object loved. Hence, as the Father speaks Himself and every
 creature by His begotten Word, inasmuch as the Word ""begotten""
 adequately represents the Father and every creature; so He loves
 Himself and every creature by the Holy Ghost, inasmuch as the Holy
 Ghost proceeds as the love of the primal goodness whereby the Father
 loves Himself and every creature. Thus it is evident that relation to
 the creature is implied both in the Word and in the proceeding Love,
 as it were in a secondary way, inasmuch as the divine truth and
 goodness are a principle of understanding and loving all creatures.

199,"[I, Q. 38, Art. 1]
","Whether ""Gift"" Is a Personal Name?
"," It would seem that ""Gift"" is not a personal name. For
 every personal name imports a distinction in God. But the name of
 ""Gift"" does not import a distinction in God; for Augustine says (De
 Trin. xv, 19): that ""the Holy Ghost is so given as God's Gift, that He
 also gives Himself as God."" Therefore ""Gift"" is not a personal name.
"," Further, no personal name belongs to the divine essence. But
 the divine essence is the Gift which the Father gives to the Son, as
 Hilary says (De Trin. ix). Therefore ""Gift"" is not a personal name.
"," Further, according to Damascene (De Fide Orth. iv, 19) there
 is no subjection nor service in the divine persons. But gift implies
 a subjection both as regards him to whom it is given, and as regards
 him by whom it is given. Therefore ""Gift"" is not a personal name.
"," Further, ""Gift"" imports relation to the creature, and it thus
 seems to be said of God in time. But personal names are said of God
 from eternity; as ""Father,"" and ""Son."" Therefore ""Gift"" is not a
 personal name.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," The name ""Gift"" imports a personal distinction, in so
 far as gift imports something belonging to another through its
 origin. Nevertheless, the Holy Ghost gives Himself, inasmuch as He is
 His own, and can use or rather enjoy Himself; as also a free man
 belongs to himself. And as Augustine says (In Joan. Tract. xxix):
 ""What is more yours than yourself?"" Or we might say, and more
 fittingly, that a gift must belong in a way to the giver. But the
 phrase, ""this is this one's,"" can be understood in several senses. In
 one way it means identity, as Augustine says (In Joan. Tract. xxix);
 and in that sense ""gift"" is the same as ""the giver,"" but not the same
 as the one to whom it is given. The Holy Ghost gives Himself in that
 sense. In another sense, a thing is another's as a possession, or as
 a slave; and in that sense gift is essentially distinct from the
 giver; and the gift of God so taken is a created thing. In a third
 sense ""this is this one's"" through its origin only; and in this sense
 the Son is the Father's; and the Holy Ghost belongs to both.
 Therefore, so far as gift in this way signifies the possession of the
 giver, it is personally distinguished from the giver, and is a
 personal name.
"," The divine essence is the Father's gift in the first
 sense, as being the Father's by way of identity.
"," Gift as a personal name in God does not imply
 subjection, but only origin, as regards the giver; but as regards the
 one to whom it is given, it implies a free use, or enjoyment, as
 above explained.
"," Gift is not so called from being actually given, but
 from its aptitude to be given. Hence the divine person is called Gift
 from eternity, although He is given in time. Nor does it follow that
 it is an essential name because it imports relation to the creature;
 but that it includes something essential in its meaning; as the
 essence is included in the idea of person, as stated above (Q. 34, A.
 3).
",,,,,,,,,,,,
200,"[I, Q. 38, Art. 2]
","Whether ""Gift"" Is the Proper Name of the Holy Ghost?
"," It would seem that Gift is not the proper name of the
 Holy Ghost. For the name Gift comes from being given. But, as Isaiah
 says (9:16): ""A Son is given to us."" Therefore to be Gift belongs to
 the Son, as well as to the Holy Ghost.
"," Further, every proper name of a person signifies a property.
 But this word Gift does not signify a property of the Holy Ghost.
 Therefore Gift is not a proper name of the Holy Ghost.
"," Further, the Holy Ghost can be called the spirit of a man,
 whereas He cannot be called the gift of any man, but ""God's Gift""
 only. Therefore Gift is not the proper name of the Holy Ghost.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," As the Son is properly called the Image because He
 proceeds by way of a word, whose nature it is to be the similitude of
 its principle, although the Holy Ghost also is like to the Father; so
 also, because the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father as love, He is
 properly called Gift, although the Son, too, is given. For that the
 Son is given is from the Father's love, according to the words, ""God
 so loved the world, as to give His only begotten Son"" (John 3:16).
"," The name Gift involves the idea of belonging to the
 Giver through its origin; and thus it imports the property of the
 origin of the Holy Ghost--that is, His procession.
"," Before a gift is given, it belongs only to the giver;
 but when it is given, it is his to whom it is given. Therefore,
 because ""Gift"" does not import the actual giving, it cannot be called
 a gift of man, but the Gift of God giving. When, however, it has been
 given, then it is the spirit of man, or a gift bestowed on man.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
201,"[I, Q. 39, Art. 1]
","Whether in God the Essence Is the Same As the Person?
"," It would seem that in God the essence is not the same as
 person. For whenever essence is the same as person or suppositum,
 there can be only one suppositum of one nature, as is clear in the
 case of all separate substances. For in those things which are really
 one and the same, one cannot be multiplied apart from the other. But
 in God there is one essence and three persons, as is clear from what
 is above expounded (Q. 28, A. 3; Q. 30, A. 2). Therefore essence is
 not the same as person.
"," Further, simultaneous affirmation and negation of the same
 things in the same respect cannot be true. But affirmation and
 negation are true of essence and of person. For person is distinct,
 whereas essence is not. Therefore person and essence are not the same.
"," Further, nothing can be subject to itself. But person is
 subject to essence; whence it is called suppositum or ""hypostasis.""
 Therefore person is not the same as essence.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," There cannot be a distinction of suppositum in
 creatures by means of relations, but only by essential principles;
 because in creatures relations are not subsistent. But in God
 relations are subsistent, and so by reason of the opposition between
 them they distinguish the supposita; and yet the essence is not
 distinguished, because the relations themselves are not distinguished
 from each other so far as they are identified with the essence.
"," As essence and person in God differ in our way
 of thinking, it follows that something can be denied of the one and
 affirmed of the other; and therefore, when we suppose the one, we need
 not suppose the other.
"," Divine things are named by us after the way of
 created things, as above explained (Q. 13, AA. 1, 3). And since
 created natures are individualized by matter which is the subject of
 the specific nature, it follows that individuals are called
 ""subjects,"" supposita, or ""hypostases."" So the divine persons are
 named supposita or ""hypostases,"" but not as if there really existed
 any real ""supposition"" or ""subjection.""
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
202,"[I, Q. 39, Art. 2]
","Whether It Must Be Said That the Three Persons Are of One Essence?
"," It would seem not right to say that the three persons are
 of one essence. For Hilary says (De Synod.) that the Father, Son and
 Holy Ghost ""are indeed three by substance, but one in harmony."" But
 the substance of God is His essence. Therefore the three persons are
 not of one essence.
"," Further, nothing is to be affirmed of God except what can be
 confirmed by the authority of Holy Writ, as appears from Dionysius
 (Div. Nom. i). Now Holy Writ never says that the Father, Son and Holy
 Ghost are of one essence. Therefore this should not be asserted.
"," Further, the divine nature is the same as the divine essence.
 It suffices therefore to say that the three persons are of one nature.
"," Further, it is not usual to say that the person is of the
 essence; but rather that the essence is of the person. Therefore it
 does not seem fitting to say that the three persons are of one
 essence.
"," Further, Augustine says (De Trin. vii, 6) that we do not say
 that the three persons are ""from one essence [ex una essentia],"" lest
 we should seem to indicate a distinction between the essence and the
 persons in God. But prepositions which imply transition, denote the
 oblique case. Therefore it is equally wrong to say that the three
 persons are ""of one essence [unius essentiae].""
"," Further, nothing should be said of God which can be occasion
 of error. Now, to say that the three persons are of one essence or
 substance, furnishes occasion of error. For, as Hilary says (De
 Synod.): ""One substance predicated of the Father and the Son
 signifies either one subsistent, with two denominations; or one
 substance divided into two imperfect substances; or a third prior
 substance taken and assumed by the other two."" Therefore it must not
 be said that the three persons are of one substance.
",,,,,,,,,,,," Substance is here taken for the ""hypostasis,"" and not
 for the essence.
"," Although we may not find it declared in Holy Writ in so
 many words that the three persons are of one essence, nevertheless we
 find it so stated as regards the meaning; for instance, ""I and the
 Father are one (John 10:30),"" and ""I am in the Father, and the Father
 in Me (John 10:38)""; and there are many other texts of the same
 import.
"," Because ""nature"" designates the principle of action
 while ""essence"" comes from being [essendo], things may be said to be
 of one nature which agree in some action, as all things which give
 heat; but only those things can be said to be of ""one essence"" which
 have one being. So the divine unity is better described by saying
 that the three persons are ""of one essence,"" than by saying they are
 ""of one nature.""
"," Form, in the absolute sense, is wont to be designated
 as belonging to that of which it is the form, as we say ""the virtue
 of Peter."" On the other hand, the thing having form is not wont to be
 designated as belonging to the form except when we wish to qualify or
 designate the form. In which case two genitives are required, one
 signifying the form, and the other signifying the determination of
 the form, as, for instance, when we say, ""Peter is of great virtue
 [magnae virtutis],"" or else one genitive must have the force of two,
 as, for instance, ""he is a man of blood""--that is, he is a man who
 sheds much blood [multi sanguinis]. So, because the divine essence
 signifies a form as regards the person, it may properly be said that
 the essence is of the person; but we cannot say the converse, unless
 we add some term to designate the essence; as, for instance, the
 Father is a person of the ""divine essence""; or, the three persons are
 ""of one essence.""
"," The preposition ""from"" or ""out of"" does not designate
 the habitude of a formal cause, but rather the habitude of an
 efficient or material cause; which causes are in all cases
 distinguished from those things of which they are the causes. For
 nothing can be its own matter, nor its own active principle. Yet a
 thing may be its own form, as appears in all immaterial things. So,
 when we say, ""three persons of one essence,"" taking essence as having
 the habitude of form, we do not mean that essence is different from
 person, which we should mean if we said, ""three persons from the same
 essence.""
"," As Hilary says (De Synod.): ""It would be prejudicial to
 holy things, if we had to do away with them, just because some do not
 think them holy. So if some misunderstand homoousion, what is that
 to me, if I understand it rightly? . . . The oneness of nature does
 not result from division, or from union or from community of
 possession, but from one nature being proper to both Father and Son.""

","Whether Essential Names Should Be Predicated in the Singular of the
"," It would seem that essential names, as the name ""God,""
 should not be predicated in the singular of the three persons, but in
 the plural. For as ""man"" signifies ""one that has humanity,"" so God
 signifies ""one that has Godhead."" But the three persons are three who
 have Godhead. Therefore the three persons are ""three Gods.""
"," Further, Gen. 1:1, where it is said, ""In the beginning God
 created heaven and earth,"" the Hebrew original has ""Elohim,"" which may
 be rendered ""Gods"" or ""Judges"": and this word is used on account of
 the plurality of persons. Therefore the three persons are ""several
 Gods,"" and not ""one"" God.
"," Further, this word ""thing"" when it is said absolutely,
 seems to belong to substance. But it is predicated of the three
 persons in the plural. For Augustine says (De Doctr. Christ. i, 5):
 ""The things that are the objects of our future glory are the Father,
 Son and Holy Ghost."" Therefore other essential names can be
 predicated in the plural of the three persons.
"," Further, as this word ""God"" signifies ""a being who has
 Deity,"" so also this word ""person"" signifies a being subsisting in
 an intellectual nature. But we say there are three persons. So for
 the same reason we can say there are ""three Gods.""
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," Though the name ""God"" signifies a being having Godhead,
 nevertheless the mode of signification is different. For the name
 ""God"" is used substantively; whereas ""having Godhead"" is used
 adjectively. Consequently, although there are ""three having Godhead,""
 it does not follow that there are three Gods.
"," Various languages have diverse modes of expression. So
 as by reason of the plurality of supposita the Greeks said ""three
 hypostases,"" so also in Hebrew ""Elohim"" is in the plural. We,
 however, do not apply the plural either to ""God"" or to ""substance,""
 lest plurality be referred to the substance.
"," This word ""thing"" is one of the transcendentals.
 Whence, so far as it is referred to relation, it is predicated of God
 in the plural; whereas, so far as it is referred to the substance, it
 is predicated in the singular. So Augustine says, in the passage
 quoted, that ""the same Trinity is a thing supreme.""
"," The form signified by the word ""person"" is not essence
 or nature, but personality. So, as there are three
 personalities--that is, three personal properties in the Father, Son
 and Holy Ghost--it is predicated of the three, not in the singular,
 but in the plural.

204,"[I, Q. 39, Art. 4]
","Whether the Concrete Essential Names Can Stand for the Person?
"," It would seem that the concrete, essential names cannot
 stand for the person, so that we can truly say ""God begot God."" For,
 as the logicians say, ""a singular term signifies what it stands for.""
 But this name ""God"" seems to be a singular term, for it cannot be
 predicated in the plural, as above explained (A. 3). Therefore, since
 it signifies the essence, it stands for essence, and not for person.
"," Further, a term in the subject is not modified by a term in
 the predicate, as to its signification; but only as to the sense
 signified in the predicate. But when I say, ""God creates,"" this name
 ""God"" stands for the essence. So when we say ""God begot,"" this term
 ""God"" cannot by reason of the notional predicate, stand for person.
"," Further, if this be true, ""God begot,"" because the Father
 generates; for the same reason this is true, ""God does not beget,""
 because the Son does not beget. Therefore there is God who begets,
 and there is God who does not beget; and thus it follows that there
 are two Gods.
"," Further, if ""God begot God,"" He begot either God, that is
 Himself, or another God. But He did not beget God, that is Himself;
 for, as Augustine says (De Trin. i, 1), ""nothing begets itself.""
 Neither did He beget another God; as there is only one God. Therefore
 it is false to say, ""God begot God.""
"," Further, if ""God begot God,"" He begot either God who is the
 Father, or God who is not the Father. If God who is the Father, then
 God the Father was begotten. If God who is not the Father, then there
 is a God who is not God the Father: which is false. Therefore it
 cannot be said that ""God begot God.""
",,,,,,,,,,,,," Although this name ""God"" agrees with singular terms as
 regards the form signified not being multiplied; nevertheless it
 agrees also with general terms so far as the form signified is to be
 found in several supposita. So it need not always stand for the
 essence it signifies.
"," This holds good against those who say that the word
 ""God"" does not naturally stand for person.
"," The word ""God"" stands for the person in a different way
 from that in which this word ""man"" does; for since the form signified
 by this word ""man""--that is, humanity--is really divided among its
 different subjects, it stands of itself for the person, even if there
 is no adjunct determining it to the person--that is, to a distinct
 subject. The unity or community of the human nature, however, is not
 a reality, but is only in the consideration of the mind. Hence this
 term ""man"" does not stand for the common nature, unless this is
 required by some adjunct, as when we say, ""man is a species""; whereas
 the form signified by the name ""God""--that is, the divine essence--is
 really one and common. So of itself it stands for the common nature,
 but by some adjunct it may be restricted so as to stand for the
 person. So, when we say, ""God generates,"" by reason of the notional
 act this name ""God"" stands for the person of the Father. But when we
 say, ""God does not generate,"" there is no adjunct to determine this
 name to the person of the Son, and hence the phrase means that
 generation is repugnant to the divine nature. If, however, something
 be added belonging to the person of the Son, this proposition, for
 instance, ""God begotten does not beget,"" is true. Consequently, it
 does not follow that there exists a ""God generator,"" and a ""God not
 generator""; unless there be an adjunct pertaining to the persons; as,
 for instance, if we were to say, ""the Father is God the generator""
 and the ""Son is God the non-generator"" and so it does not follow that
 there are many Gods; for the Father and the Son are one God, as was
 said above (A. 3).
"," This is false, ""the Father begot God, that is Himself,""
 because the word ""Himself,"" as a reciprocal term, refers to the same
 suppositum. Nor is this contrary to what Augustine says (Ep. lxvi
 ad Maxim.) that ""God the Father begot another self [alterum se],""
 forasmuch as the word ""se"" is either in the ablative case, and then
 it means ""He begot another from Himself,"" or it indicates a single
 relation, and thus points to identity of nature. This is, however,
 either a figurative or an emphatic way of speaking, so that it would
 really mean, ""He begot another most like to Himself."" Likewise also
 it is false to say, ""He begot another God,"" because although the Son
 is another than the Father, as above explained (Q. 31, A. 2),
 nevertheless it cannot be said that He is ""another God""; forasmuch as
 this adjective ""another"" would be understood to apply to the
 substantive God; and thus the meaning would be that there is a
 distinction of Godhead. Yet this proposition ""He begot another God""
 is tolerated by some, provided that ""another"" be taken as a
 substantive, and the word ""God"" be construed in apposition with it.
 This, however, is an inexact way of speaking, and to be avoided, for
 fear of giving occasion to error.
"," To say, ""God begot God Who is God the Father,"" is
 wrong, because since the word ""Father"" is construed in apposition to
 ""God,"" the word ""God"" is restricted to the person of the Father; so
 that it would mean, ""He begot God, Who is Himself the Father""; and
 then the Father would be spoken of as begotten, which is false.
 Wherefore the negative of the proposition is true, ""He begot God Who
 is not God the Father."" If however, we understand these words not to
 be in apposition, and require something to be added, then, on the
 contrary, the affirmative proposition is true, and the negative is
 false; so that the meaning would be, ""He begot God Who is God Who is
 the Father."" Such a rendering however appears to be forced, so that
 it is better to say simply that the affirmative proposition is false,
 and the negative is true. Yet Prepositivus said that both the
 negative and affirmative are false, because this relative ""Who"" in
 the affirmative proposition can be referred to the suppositum;
 whereas in the negative it denotes both the thing signified and the
 suppositum. Whence, in the affirmative the sense is that ""to be God
 the Father"" is befitting to the person of the Son; and in the
 negative sense is that ""to be God the Father,"" is to be removed from
 the Son's divinity as well as from His personality. This, however,
 appears to be irrational; since, according to the Philosopher (Peri
 Herm. ii), what is open to affirmation, is open also to negation.

205,"[I, Q. 39, Art. 5]
","Whether Abstract Essential Names Can Stand for the Person?
"," It would seem that abstract essential names can stand
 for the person, so that this proposition is true, ""Essence begets
 essence."" For Augustine says (De Trin. vii, i, 2): ""The Father and
 the Son are one Wisdom, because they are one essence; and taken
 singly Wisdom is from Wisdom, as essence from essence.""
"," Further, generation or corruption in ourselves implies
 generation or corruption of what is within us. But the Son is
 generated. Therefore since the divine essence is in the Son, it
 seems that the divine essence is generated.
"," Further, God and the divine essence are the same, as is clear
 from what is above explained (Q. 3, A. 3). But, as was shown, it is
 true to say that ""God begets God."" Therefore this is also true:
 ""Essence begets essence.""
"," Further, a predicate can stand for that of which it is
 predicated. But the Father is the divine essence; therefore essence
 can stand for the person of the Father. Thus the essence begets.
"," Further, the essence is ""a thing begetting,"" because the
 essence is the Father who is begetting. Therefore if the essence is
 not begetting, the essence will be ""a thing begetting,"" and ""not
 begetting"": which cannot be.
"," Further, Augustine says (De Trin. iv, 20): ""The Father is the
 principle of the whole Godhead."" But He is principle only by
 begetting or spirating. Therefore the Father begets or spirates the
 Godhead.
",,,,,,,,,,,," To express unity of essence and of person, the holy
 Doctors have sometimes expressed themselves with greater emphasis
 than the strict propriety of terms allows. Whence instead of
 enlarging upon such expressions we should rather explain them: thus,
 for instance, abstract names should be explained by concrete names,
 or even by personal names; as when we find ""essence from essence""; or
 ""wisdom from wisdom""; we should take the sense to be, the Son who
 is essence and wisdom, is from the Father who is essence and wisdom.
 Nevertheless, as regards these abstract names a certain order should
 be observed, forasmuch as what belongs to action is more nearly
 allied to the persons because actions belong to supposita. So
 ""nature from nature,"" and ""wisdom from wisdom"" are less inexact than
 ""essence from essence.""
"," In creatures the one generated has not the same nature
 numerically as the generator, but another nature, numerically
 distinct, which commences to exist in it anew by generation, and
 ceases to exist by corruption, and so it is generated and corrupted
 accidentally; whereas God begotten has the same nature numerically as
 the begetter. So the divine nature in the Son is not begotten either
 directly or accidentally.
"," Although God and the divine essence are really the
 same, nevertheless, on account of their different mode of
 signification, we must speak in a different way about each of them.
"," The divine essence is predicated of the Father by mode
 of identity by reason of the divine simplicity; yet it does not
 follow that it can stand for the Father, its mode of signification
 being different. This objection would hold good as regards things
 which are predicated of another as the universal of a particular.
"," The difference between substantive and adjectival names
 consist in this, that the former carry their subject with them,
 whereas the latter do not, but add the thing signified to the
 substantive. Whence logicians are wont to say that the substantive is
 considered in the light of suppositum, whereas the adjective
 indicates something added to the suppositum. Therefore substantive
 personal terms can be predicated of the essence, because they are
 really the same; nor does it follow that a personal property makes a
 distinct essence; but it belongs to the suppositum implied in the
 substantive. But notional and personal adjectives cannot be
 predicated of the essence unless we add some substantive. We cannot
 say that the ""essence is begetting""; yet we can say that the ""essence
 is a thing begetting,"" or that it is ""God begetting,"" if ""thing"" and
 God stand for person, but not if they stand for essence. Consequently
 there exists no contradiction in saying that ""essence is a thing
 begetting,"" and ""a thing not begetting""; because in the first case
 ""thing"" stands for person, and in the second it stands for the
 essence.
"," So far as Godhead is one in several supposita, it
 agrees in a certain degree with the form of a collective term. So
 when we say, ""the Father is the principle of the whole Godhead,"" the
 term Godhead can be taken for all the persons together, inasmuch as
 it is the principle in all the divine persons. Nor does it follow
 that He is His own principle; as one of the people may be called the
 ruler of the people without being ruler of himself. We may also say
 that He is the principle of the whole Godhead; not as generating or
 spirating it, but as communicating it by generation and spiration.
",,,,,,,,,,
206,"[I, Q. 39, Art. 6]
","Whether the Persons Can Be Predicated of the Essential Terms?
"," It would seem that the persons cannot be predicated of
 the concrete essential names; so that we can say for instance, ""God is
 three persons""; or ""God is the Trinity."" For it is false to say, ""man
 is every man,"" because it cannot be verified as regards any particular
 subject. For neither Socrates, nor Plato, nor anyone else is every
 man. In the same way this proposition, ""God is the Trinity,"" cannot be
 verified of any one of the supposita of the divine nature. For the
 Father is not the Trinity; nor is the Son; nor is the Holy Ghost. So
 to say, ""God is the Trinity,"" is false.
"," Further, the lower is not predicated of the higher except
 by accidental predication; as when I say, ""animal is man""; for it is
 accidental to animal to be man. But this name ""God"" as regards the
 three persons is as a general term to inferior terms, as Damascene
 says (De Fide Orth. iii, 4). Therefore it seems that the names of
 the persons cannot be predicated of this name ""God,"" except in an
 accidental sense.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,," As above explained this term ""man"" can of itself stand
 for person, whereas an adjunct is required for it to stand for the
 universal human nature. So it is false to say, ""Man is every man"";
 because it cannot be verified of any particular human subject. On the
 contrary, this word ""God"" can of itself be taken for the divine
 essence. So, although to say of any of the supposita of the divine
 nature, ""God is the Trinity,"" is untrue, nevertheless it is true of
 the divine essence. This was denied by Porretanus because he did not
 take note of this distinction.
"," When we say, ""God,"" or ""the divine essence is the
 Father,"" the predication is one of identity, and not of the lower in
 regard to a higher species: because in God there is no universal and
 singular. Hence, as this proposition, ""The Father is God"" is of
 itself true, so this proposition ""God is the Father"" is true of
 itself, and by no means accidentally.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
207,"[I, Q. 39, Art. 7]
","Whether the Essential Names Should Be Appropriated to the Persons?
"," It would seem that the essential names should not be
 appropriated to the persons. For whatever might verge on error in
 faith should be avoided in the treatment of divine things; for, as
 Jerome says, ""careless words involve risk of heresy"" [*In substance
 Ep. lvii.]. But to appropriate to any one person the names which are
 common to the three persons, may verge on error in faith; for it may
 be supposed either that such belong only to the person to whom they
 are appropriated or that they belong to Him in a fuller degree than
 to the others. Therefore the essential attributes should not be
 appropriated to the persons.
"," Further, the essential attributes expressed in the abstract
 signify by mode of form. But one person is not as a form to another;
 since a form is not distinguished in subject from that of which it is
 the form. Therefore the essential attributes, especially when
 expressed in the abstract, are not to be appropriated to the persons.
"," Further, property is prior to the appropriated, for property
 is included in the idea of the appropriated. But the essential
 attributes, in our way of understanding, are prior to the persons; as
 what is common is prior to what is proper. Therefore the essential
 attributes are not to be appropriated to the persons.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The essential attributes are not appropriated to the
 persons as if they exclusively belonged to them; but in order to make
 the persons manifest by way of similitude, or dissimilitude, as above
 explained. So, no error in faith can arise, but rather manifestation
 of the truth.
"," If the essential attributes were appropriated to the
 persons as exclusively belonging to each of them, then it would
 follow that one person would be as a form as regards another; which
 Augustine altogether repudiates (De Trin. vi, 2), showing that the
 Father is wise, not by Wisdom begotten by Him, as though only the Son
 were Wisdom; so that the Father and the Son together only can be
 called wise, but not the Father without the Son. But the Son is
 called the Wisdom of the Father, because He is Wisdom from the Father
 Who is Wisdom. For each of them is of Himself Wisdom; and both
 together are one Wisdom. Whence the Father is not wise by the wisdom
 begotten by Him, but by the wisdom which is His own essence.
"," Although the essential attribute is in its proper
 concept prior to person, according to our way of understanding;
 nevertheless, so far as it is appropriated, there is nothing to
 prevent the personal property from being prior to that which is
 appropriated. Thus color is posterior to body considered as body,
 but is naturally prior to ""white body,"" considered as white.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
208,"[I, Q. 39, Art. 8]
","Whether the Essential Attributes Are Appropriated to the Persons in
"," It would seem that the essential attributes are
 appropriated to the persons unfittingly by the holy doctors. For
 Hilary says (De Trin. ii): ""Eternity is in the Father, the species in
 the Image; and use is in the Gift."" In which words he designates
 three names proper to the persons: the name of the ""Father,"" the name
 ""Image"" proper to the Son (Q. 35, A. 2), and the name ""Bounty"" or
 ""Gift,"" which is proper to the Holy Ghost (Q. 38, A. 2). He also
 designates three appropriated terms. For he appropriates ""eternity""
 to the Father, species to the Son, and ""use"" to the Holy Ghost.
 This he does apparently without reason. For ""eternity"" imports
 duration of existence; species, the principle of existence; and
 'use' belongs to the operation. But essence and operation are not
 found to be appropriated to any person. Therefore the above terms are
 not fittingly appropriated to the persons.
"," Further, Augustine says (De Doctr. Christ. i, 5): ""Unity is
 in the Father, equality in the Son, and in the Holy Ghost is the
 concord of equality and unity."" This does not, however, seem fitting;
 because one person does not receive formal denomination from what is
 appropriated to another. For the Father is not wise by the wisdom
 begotten, as above explained (Q. 37, A. 2, ad 1). But, as he
 subjoins, ""All these three are one by the Father; all are equal by
 the Son, and all united by the Holy Ghost."" The above, therefore, are
 not fittingly appropriated to the Persons.
"," Further, according to Augustine, to the Father is attributed
 ""power,"" to the Son ""wisdom,"" to the Holy Ghost ""goodness."" Nor does
 this seem fitting; for ""strength"" is part of power, whereas strength
 is found to be appropriated to the Son, according to the text,
 ""Christ the strength [*Douay: power] of God"" (1 Cor. 1:24). So it is
 likewise appropriated to the Holy Ghost, according to the words,
 ""strength [*Douay: virtue] came out from Him and healed all"" (Luke
 6:19). Therefore power should not be appropriated to the Father.
"," Likewise Augustine says (De Trin. vi, 10): ""What the Apostle
 says, ""From Him, and by Him, and in Him,"" is not to be taken in a
 confused sense."" And (Contra Maxim. ii) ""'from Him' refers to the
 Father, 'by Him' to the Son, 'in Him' to the Holy Ghost."" This,
 however, seems to be incorrectly said; for the words ""in Him"" seem to
 imply the relation of final cause, which is first among the causes.
 Therefore this relation of cause should be appropriated to the
 Father, Who is ""the principle from no principle.""
"," Likewise, Truth is appropriated to the Son, according to John
 14:6, ""I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life""; and likewise ""the book
 of life,"" according to Ps. 39:9, ""In the beginning of the book it is
 written of Me,"" where a gloss observes, ""that is, with the Father Who
 is My head,"" also this word ""Who is""; because on the text of Isaias,
 ""Behold I go to the Gentiles"" (65:1), a gloss adds, ""The Son speaks
 Who said to Moses, I am Who am."" These appear to belong to the Son,
 and are not appropriated. For ""truth,"" according to Augustine (De
 Vera Relig. 36), ""is the supreme similitude of the principle without
 any dissimilitude."" So it seems that it properly belongs to the Son,
 Who has a principle. Also the ""book of life"" seems proper to the Son,
 as signifying ""a thing from another""; for every book is written by
 someone. This also, ""Who is,"" appears to be proper to the Son;
 because if when it was said to Moses, ""I am Who am,"" the Trinity
 spoke, then Moses could have said, ""He Who is Father, Son, and Holy
 Ghost, and the Holy Ghost sent me to you,"" so also he could have said
 further, ""He Who is the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost sent
 me to you,"" pointing out a certain person. This, however, is false;
 because no person is Father, Son and Holy Ghost. Therefore it cannot
 be common to the Trinity, but is proper to the Son.

209,"[I, Q. 40, Art. 1]
","Whether Relation Is the Same As Person?
"," It would seem that in God relation is not the same as
 person. For when things are identical, if one is multiplied the others
 are multiplied. But in one person there are several relations; as in
 the person of the Father there is paternity and common spiration.
 Again, one relation exists in two person, as common spiration in the
 Father and in the Son. Therefore relation is not the same as person.
"," Further, according to the Philosopher (Phys. iv, text. 24),
 nothing is contained by itself. But relation is in the person; nor
 can it be said that this occurs because they are identical, for
 otherwise relation would be also in the essence. Therefore relation,
 or property, is not the same as person in God.
"," Further, when several things are identical, what is
 predicated of one is predicated of the others. But all that is
 predicated of a Person is not predicated of His property. For we say
 that the Father begets; but not that the paternity is begetting.
 Therefore property is not the same as person in God.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Person and property are really the same, but differ in
 concept. Consequently, it does not follow that if one is multiplied,
 the other must also be multiplied. We must, however, consider that in
 God, by reason of the divine simplicity, a twofold real identity
 exists as regards what in creatures are distinct. For, since the
 divine simplicity excludes the composition of matter and form, it
 follows that in God the abstract is the same as the concrete, as
 ""Godhead"" and ""God."" And as the divine simplicity excludes the
 composition of subject and accident, it follows that whatever is
 attributed to God, is His essence Itself; and so, wisdom and power
 are the same in God, because they are both in the divine essence.
 According to this twofold identity, property in God is the same as
 person. For personal properties are the same as the persons because
 the abstract and the concrete are the same in God; since they are the
 subsisting persons themselves, as paternity is the Father Himself,
 and filiation is the Son, and procession is the Holy Ghost. But the
 non-personal properties are the same as the persons according to the
 other reason of identity, whereby whatever is attributed to God is
 His own essence. Thus, common spiration is the same as the person of
 the Father, and the person of the Son; not that it is one
 self-subsisting person; but that as there is one essence in the two
 persons, so also there is one property in the two persons, as above
 explained (Q. 30, A. 2).
"," The properties are said to be in the essence, only by
 mode of identity; but in the persons they exist by mode of identity,
 not merely in reality, but also in the mode of signification; as the
 form exists in its subject. Thus the properties determine and
 distinguish the persons, but not the essence.
"," Notional participles and verbs signify the notional
 acts: and acts belong to a suppositum. Now, properties are not
 designated as supposita, but as forms of supposita. And so their
 mode of signification is against notional participles and verbs being
 predicated of the properties.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
210,"[I, Q. 40, Art. 2]
","Whether the Persons Are Distinguished by the Relations?
"," It would seem that the persons are not distinguished by
 the relations. For simple things are distinct by themselves. But the
 persons are supremely simple. Therefore they are distinguished by
 themselves, and not by the relation.
"," Further, a form is distinguished only in relation to its
 genus. For white is distinguished from black only by quality. But
 ""hypostasis"" signifies an individual in the genus of substance.
 Therefore the hypostases cannot be distinguished by relations.
"," Further, what is absolute comes before what is relative. But
 the distinction of the divine persons is the primary distinction.
 Therefore the divine persons are not distinguished by the relations.
"," Further, whatever presupposes distinction cannot be the first
 principle of distinction. But relation presupposes distinction, which
 comes into its definition; for a relation is essentially what is
 towards another. Therefore the first distinctive principle in God
 cannot be relation.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," The persons are the subsisting relations themselves.
 Hence it is not against the simplicity of the divine persons for them
 to be distinguished by the relations.
"," The divine persons are not distinguished as regards
 being, in which they subsist, nor in anything absolute, but only as
 regards something relative. Hence relation suffices for their
 distinction.
"," The more prior a distinction is, the nearer it
 approaches to unity; and so it must be the least possible
 distinction. So the distinction of the persons must be by that which
 distinguishes the least possible; and this is by relation.
"," Relation presupposes the distinction of the subjects,
 when it is an accident; but when the relation is subsistent, it does
 not presuppose, but brings about distinction. For when it is said
 that relation is by nature to be towards another, the word ""another""
 signifies the correlative which is not prior, but simultaneous in the
 order of nature.
",,,,,,,,,,,,
211,"[I, Q. 40, Art. 3]
","Whether the Hypostases Remain If the Relations Are Mentally Abstracted
"," It would seem that the hypostases remain if the
 properties or relations are mentally abstracted from the persons. For
 that to which something is added, may be understood when the addition
 is taken away; as man is something added to animal which can be
 understood if rational be taken away. But person is something added to
 hypostasis; for person is ""a hypostasis distinguished by a property of
 dignity."" Therefore, if a personal property be taken away from a
 person, the hypostasis remains.
"," Further, that the Father is Father, and that He is someone,
 are not due to the same reason. For as He is the Father by paternity,
 supposing He is some one by paternity, it would follow that the Son,
 in Whom there is not paternity, would not be ""someone."" So when
 paternity is mentally abstracted from the Father, He still remains
 ""someone""--that is, a hypostasis. Therefore, if property be removed
 from person, the hypostasis remains.
"," Further, Augustine says (De Trin. v, 6): ""Unbegotten is not
 the same as Father; for if the Father had not begotten the Son,
 nothing would prevent Him being called unbegotten."" But if He had not
 begotten the Son, there would be no paternity in Him. Therefore, if
 paternity be removed, there still remains the hypostasis of the
 Father as unbegotten.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Person does not add to hypostasis a distinguishing
 property absolutely, but a distinguishing property of dignity, all
 of which must be taken as the difference. Now, this distinguishing
 property is one of dignity precisely because it is understood as
 subsisting in a rational nature. Hence, if the distinguishing
 property be removed from the person, the hypostasis no longer
 remains; whereas it would remain were the rationality of the nature
 removed; for both person and hypostasis are individual substances.
 Consequently, in God the distinguishing relation belongs essentially
 to both.
"," By paternity the Father is not only Father, but is a
 person, and is ""someone,"" or a hypostasis. It does not follow,
 however, that the Son is not ""someone"" or a hypostasis; just as it
 does not follow that He is not a person.
"," Augustine does not mean to say that the hypostasis of
 the Father would remain as unbegotten, if His paternity were removed,
 as if innascibility constituted and distinguished the hypostasis of
 the Father; for this would be impossible, since ""being unbegotten""
 says nothing positive and is only a negation, as he himself says. But
 he speaks in a general sense, forasmuch as not every unbegotten being
 is the Father. So, if paternity be removed, the hypostasis of the
 Father does not remain in God, as distinguished from the other
 persons, but only as distinguished from creatures; as the Jews
 understand it.

212,"[I, Q. 40, Art. 4]
","Whether the properties presuppose the notional acts?
"," It would seem that the notional acts are understood
 before the properties. For the Master of the Sentences says (Sent. i,
 D, xxvii) that ""the Father always is, because He is ever begetting the
 Son."" So it seems that generation precedes paternity in the order of
 intelligence.
"," Further, in the order of intelligence every relation
 presupposes that on which it is founded; as equality presupposes
 quantity. But paternity is a relation founded on the action of
 generation. Therefore paternity presupposes generation.
"," Further, active generation is to paternity as nativity is
 to filiation. But filiation presupposes nativity; for the Son is so
 called because He is born. Therefore paternity also presupposes
 generation.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," When the Master says that ""because He begets, He is
 Father,"" the term ""Father"" is taken as meaning relation only, but not
 as signifying the subsisting person; for then it would be necessary
 to say conversely that because He is Father He begets.
"," This objection avails of paternity as a relation, but
 not as constituting a person.
"," Nativity is the way to the person of the Son; and so,
 in the order of intelligence, it precedes filiation, even as
 constituting the person of the Son. But active generation signifies a
 proceeding from the person of the Father; wherefore it presupposes
 the personal property of the Father.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
213,"[I, Q. 41, Art. 1]
","Whether the Notional Acts Are to Be Attributed to the Persons?
"," It would seem that the notional acts are not to be
 attributed to the persons. For Boethius says (De Trin.): ""Whatever
 is predicated of God, of whatever genus it be, becomes the divine
 substance, except what pertains to the relation."" But action is one
 of the ten genera. Therefore any action attributed to God belongs
 to His essence, and not to a notion.
"," Further, Augustine says (De Trin. v, 4,5) that, ""everything
 which is said of God, is said of Him as regards either His substance,
 or relation."" But whatever belongs to the substance is signified by
 the essential attributes; and whatever belongs to the relations, by
 the names of the persons, or by the names of the properties.
 Therefore, in addition to these, notional acts are not to be
 attributed to the persons.
"," Further, the nature of action is of itself to cause passion.
 But we do not place passions in God. Therefore neither are notional
 acts to be placed in God.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Every origin is designated by an act. In God there is a
 twofold order of origin: one, inasmuch as the creature proceeds from
 Him, and this is common to the three persons; and so those actions
 which are attributed to God to designate the proceeding of creatures
 from Him, belong to His essence. Another order of origin in God
 regards the procession of person from person; wherefore the acts
 which designate the order of this origin are called notional; because
 the notions of the persons are the mutual relations of the persons,
 as is clear from what was above explained (Q. 32, A. 2).
"," The notional acts differ from the relations of the
 persons only in their mode of signification; and in reality are
 altogether the same. Whence the Master says that ""generation and
 nativity in other words are paternity and filiation"" (Sent. i, D,
 xxvi). To see this, we must consider that the origin of one thing
 from another is firstly inferred from movement: for that anything be
 changed from its disposition by movement evidently arises from some
 cause. Hence action, in its primary sense, means origin of movement;
 for, as movement derived from another into a mobile object, is called
 ""passion,"" so the origin of movement itself as beginning from another
 and terminating in what is moved, is called ""action."" Hence, if we
 take away movement, action implies nothing more than order of origin,
 in so far as action proceeds from some cause or principle to what is
 from that principle. Consequently, since in God no movement exists,
 the personal action of the one producing a person is only the
 habitude of the principle to the person who is from the principle;
 which habitudes are the relations, or the notions. Nevertheless we
 cannot speak of divine and intelligible things except after the
 manner of sensible things, whence we derive our knowledge, and
 wherein actions and passions, so far as these imply movement, differ
 from the relations which result from action and passion, and
 therefore it was necessary to signify the habitudes of the persons
 separately after the manner of act, and separately after the manner
 of relations. Thus it is evident that they are really the same,
 differing only in their mode of signification.
"," Action, so far as it means origin of movement,
 naturally involves passion; but action in that sense is not
 attributed to God. Whence, passions are attributed to Him only from a
 grammatical standpoint, and in accordance with our manner of
 speaking, as we attribute ""to beget"" with the Father, and to the Son
 ""to be begotten.""
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
214,"[I, Q. 41, Art. 2]
","Whether the Notional Acts Are Voluntary?
"," It would seem that the notional acts are voluntary. For
 Hilary says (De Synod.): ""Not by natural necessity was the Father led
 to beget the Son.""
"," Further, the Apostle says, ""He transferred us to the kingdom
 of the Son of His love"" (Col. 1:13). But love belongs to the will.
 Therefore the Son was begotten of the Father by will.
"," Further, nothing is more voluntary than love. But the Holy
 Ghost proceeds as Love from the Father and the Son. Therefore He
 proceeds voluntarily.
"," Further, the Son proceeds by mode of the intellect, as the
 Word. But every word proceeds by the will from a speaker. Therefore
 the Son proceeds from the Father by will, and not by nature.
"," Further, what is not voluntary is necessary. Therefore if the
 Father begot the Son, not by the will, it seems to follow that He
 begot Him by necessity; and this is against what Augustine says (Ad
 Orosium qu. vii).
",,,,,,,,,,,,," This saying is directed against those who did not admit
 even the concomitance of the Father's will in the generation of the
 Son, for they said that the Father begot the Son in such a manner by
 nature that the will to beget was wanting; just as we ourselves
 suffer many things against our will from natural necessity--as, for
 instance, death, old age, and like ills. This appears from what
 precedes and from what follows as regards the words quoted, for thus
 we read: ""Not against His will, nor as it were, forced, nor as if He
 were led by natural necessity did the Father beget the Son.""
"," The Apostle calls Christ the Son of the love of God,
 inasmuch as He is superabundantly loved by God; not, however, as if
 love were the principle of the Son's generation.
"," The will, as a natural faculty, wills something
 naturally, as man's will naturally tends to happiness; and likewise
 God naturally wills and loves Himself; whereas in regard to things
 other than Himself, the will of God is in a way, undetermined in
 itself, as above explained (Q. 19, A. 3). Now, the Holy Ghost
 proceeds as Love, inasmuch as God loves Himself, and hence He
 proceeds naturally, although He proceeds by mode of will.
"," Even as regards the intellectual conceptions of the
 mind, a return is made to those first principles which are naturally
 understood. But God naturally understands Himself, and thus the
 conception of the divine Word is natural.
"," A thing is said to be necessary ""of itself,"" and ""by
 reason of another."" Taken in the latter sense, it has a twofold
 meaning: firstly, as an efficient and compelling cause, and thus
 necessary means what is violent; secondly, it means a final cause,
 when a thing is said to be necessary as the means to an end, so far
 as without it the end could not be attained, or, at least, so well
 attained. In neither of these ways is the divine generation
 necessary; because God is not the means to an end, nor is He subject
 to compulsion. But a thing is said to be necessary ""of itself"" which
 cannot but be: in this sense it is necessary for God to be; and in
 the same sense it is necessary that the Father beget the Son.
",,,,,,,,,,,
215,"[I, Q. 41, Art. 3]
","Whether the Notional Acts Proceed from Something?
"," It would seem that the notional acts do not proceed from
 anything. For if the Father begets the Son from something, this will
 be either from Himself or from something else. If from something else,
 since that whence a thing is generated exists in what is generated, it
 follows that something different from the Father exists in the Son,
 and this contradicts what is laid down by Hilary (De Trin. vii) that,
 ""In them nothing diverse or different exists."" If the Father begets
 the Son from Himself, since again that whence a thing is generated, if
 it be something permanent, receives as predicate the thing generated
 therefrom just as we say, ""The man is white,"" since the man remains,
 when not from white he is made white--it follows that either the
 Father does not remain after the Son is begotten, or that the Father
 is the Son, which is false. Therefore the Father does not beget the
 Son from something, but from nothing.
"," Further, that whence anything is generated is the principle
 regarding what is generated. So if the Father generate the Son from
 His own essence or nature, it follows that the essence or nature of
 the Father is the principle of the Son. But it is not a material
 principle, because in God nothing material exists; and therefore it
 is, as it were, an active principle, as the begetter is the principle
 of the one begotten. Thus it follows that the essence generates,
 which was disproved above (Q. 39, A. 5).
"," Further, Augustine says (De Trin. vii, 6) that the three
 persons are not from the same essence; because the essence is not
 another thing from person. But the person of the Son is not another
 thing from the Father's essence. Therefore the Son is not from the
 Father's essence.
"," Further, every creature is from nothing. But in Scripture
 the Son is called a creature; for it is said (Ecclus. 24:5), in the
 person of the Wisdom begotten,""I came out of the mouth of the Most
 High, the first-born before all creatures"": and further on (Ecclus.
 24:14) it is said as uttered by the same Wisdom, ""From the beginning,
 and before the world was I created."" Therefore the Son was not
 begotten from something, but from nothing. Likewise we can object
 concerning the Holy Ghost, by reason of what is said (Zech. 12:1):
 ""Thus saith the Lord Who stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the
 foundations of the earth, and formeth the spirit of man within him"";
 and (Amos 4:13) according to another version [*The Septuagint]: ""I
 Who form the earth, and create the spirit.""
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," When we say that the Son was born of the Father, the
 preposition ""of"" designates a consubstantial generating principle,
 but not a material principle. For that which is produced from matter,
 is made by a change of form in that whence it is produced. But the
 divine essence is unchangeable, and is not susceptive of another form.
"," When we say the Son is begotten of the essence of the
 Father, as the Master of the Sentences explains (Sent. i, D, v), this
 denotes the habitude of a kind of active principle, and as he
 expounds, ""the Son is begotten of the essence of the Father""--that
 is, of the Father Who is essence; and so Augustine says (De Trin. xv,
 13): ""When I say of the Father Who is essence, it is the same as if I
 said more explicitly, of the essence of the Father.""
"," When we say that the Son is begotten of the essence of
 the Father, a term is added which saves the distinction. But when we
 say that the three persons are 'of' the divine essence, there is
 nothing expressed to warrant the distinction signified by the
 preposition, so there is no parity of argument.
"," When we say ""Wisdom was created,"" this may be
 understood not of Wisdom which is the Son of God, but of created
 wisdom given by God to creatures: for it is said, ""He created her
 [namely, Wisdom] in the Holy Ghost, and He poured her out over all
 His works"" (Ecclus. 1:9, 10). Nor is it inconsistent for Scripture in
 one text to speak of the Wisdom begotten and wisdom created, for
 wisdom created is a kind of participation of the uncreated Wisdom.
 The saying may also be referred to the created nature assumed by the
 Son, so that the sense be, ""From the beginning and before the world
 was I made""--that is, I was foreseen as united to the creature. Or
 the mention of wisdom as both created and begotten insinuates into
 our minds the mode of the divine generation; for in generation what
 is generated receives the nature of the generator and this pertains
 to perfection; whereas in creation the Creator is not changed, but
 the creature does not receive the Creator's nature. Thus the Son is
 called both created and begotten, in order that from the idea of
 creation the immutability of the Father may be understood, and from
 generation the unity of nature in the Father and the Son. In this way
 Hilary expounds the sense of this text of Scripture (De Synod.). The
 other passages quoted do not refer to the Holy Ghost, but to the
 created spirit, sometimes called wind, sometimes air, sometimes the
 breath of man, sometimes also the soul, or any other invisible
 substance.
",,,,,,,,,,,,
216,"[I, Q. 41, Art. 4]
","Whether in God There Is a Power in Respect of the Notional Acts?
"," It would seem that in God there is no power in respect
 of the notional acts. For every kind of power is either active or
 passive; neither of which can be here applied, there being in God
 nothing which we call passive power, as above explained (Q. 25, A.
 1); nor can active power belong to one person as regards another,
 since the divine persons were not made, as stated above (A. 3).
 Therefore in God there is no power in respect of the notional acts.
"," Further, the object of power is what is possible. But the
 divine persons are not regarded as possible, but necessary.
 Therefore, as regards the notional acts, whereby the divine persons
 proceed, there cannot be power in God.
"," Further, the Son proceeds as the word, which is the concept
 of the intellect; and the Holy Ghost proceeds as love, which belongs
 to the will. But in God power exists as regards effects, and not as
 regards intellect and will, as stated above (Q. 25, A. 1). Therefore,
 in God power does not exist in reference to the notional acts.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," As a person, according to notional acts, does not
 proceed as if made; so the power in God as regards the notional acts
 has no reference to a person as if made, but only as regards the
 person as proceeding.
"," Possible, as opposed to what is necessary, is a
 consequence of a passive power, which does not exist in God. Hence,
 in God there is no such thing as possibility in this sense, but only
 in the sense of possible as contained in what is necessary; and in
 this latter sense it can be said that as it is possible for God to
 be, so also is it possible that the Son should be generated.
"," Power signifies a principle: and a principle implies
 distinction from that of which it is the principle. Now we must
 observe a double distinction in things said of God: one is a real
 distinction, the other is a distinction of reason only. By a real
 distinction, God by His essence is distinct from those things of
 which He is the principle by creation: just as one person is distinct
 from the other of which He is principle by a notional act. But in God
 the distinction of action and agent is one of reason only, otherwise
 action would be an accident in God. And therefore with regard to
 those actions in respect of which certain things proceed which are
 distinct from God, either personally or essentially, we may ascribe
 power to God in its proper sense of principle. And as we ascribe to
 God the power of creating, so we may ascribe the power of begetting
 and of spirating. But ""to understand"" and ""to will"" are not such
 actions as to designate the procession of something distinct from
 God, either essentially or personally. Wherefore, with regard to
 these actions we cannot ascribe power to God in its proper sense, but
 only after our way of understanding and speaking: inasmuch as we
 designate by different terms the intellect and the act of
 understanding in God, whereas in God the act of understanding is His
 very essence which has no principle.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
217,"[I, Q. 41, Art. 5]
","Whether the Power of Begetting Signifies a Relation, and Not the
"," It would seem that the power of begetting, or of
 spirating, signifies the relation and not the essence. For power
 signifies a principle, as appears from its definition: for active
 power is the principle of action, as we find in Metaph. v, text 17.
 But in God principle in regard to Person is said notionally.
 Therefore, in God, power does not signify essence but relation.
"," Further, in God, the power to act [posse] and 'to act' are
 not distinct. But in God, begetting signifies relation. Therefore,
 the same applies to the power of begetting.
"," Further, terms signifying the essence in God, are common to
 the three persons. But the power of begetting is not common to the
 three persons, but proper to the Father. Therefore it does not
 signify the essence.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Power does not signify the relation itself of a
 principle, for thus it would be in the genus of relation; but it
 signifies that which is a principle; not, indeed, in the sense in
 which we call the agent a principle, but in the sense of being that
 by which the agent acts. Now the agent is distinct from that which it
 makes, and the generator from that which it generates: but that by
 which the generator generates is common to generated and generator,
 and so much more perfectly, as the generation is more perfect. Since,
 therefore, the divine generation is most perfect, that by which the
 Begetter begets, is common to Begotten and Begetter by a community of
 identity, and not only of species, as in things created. Therefore,
 from the fact that we say that the divine essence ""is the principle
 by which the Begetter begets,"" it does not follow that the divine
 essence is distinct (from the Begotten): which would follow if we
 were to say that the divine essence begets.
"," As in God, the power of begetting is the same as the
 act of begetting, so the divine essence is the same in reality as the
 act of begetting or paternity; although there is a distinction of
 reason.
"," When I speak of the ""power of begetting,"" power is
 signified directly, generation indirectly: just as if I were to say,
 the ""essence of the Father."" Wherefore in respect of the essence,
 which is signified, the power of begetting is common to the three
 persons: but in respect of the notion that is connoted, it is proper
 to the person of the Father.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
218,"[I, Q. 41, Art. 6]
","Whether Several Persons Can Be the Term of One Notional Act?
"," It would seem that a notional act can be directed to
 several Persons, so that there may be several Persons begotten or
 spirated in God. For whoever has the power of begetting can beget. But
 the Son has the power of begetting. Therefore He can beget. But He
 cannot beget Himself: therefore He can beget another son. Therefore
 there can be several Sons in God.
"," Further, Augustine says (Contra Maxim. iii, 12): ""The Son
 did not beget a Creator: not that He could not, but that it behoved
 Him not.""
"," Further, God the Father has greater power to beget than
 has a created father. But a man can beget several sons. Therefore God
 can also: the more so that the power of the Father is not diminished
 after begetting the Son.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," We can grant, without distinction, that the Son has the
 same power as the Father; but we cannot grant that the Son has the
 power ""generandi"" [of begetting] thus taking ""generandi"" as the
 gerund of the active verb, so that the sense would be that the Son
 has the ""power to beget."" Just as, although Father and Son have the
 same being, it does not follow that the Son is the Father, by reason
 of the notional term added. But if the word ""generandi"" [of being
 begotten] is taken as the gerundive of the passive verb, the power
 ""generandi"" is in the Son--that is, the power of being begotten. The
 same is to be said if it be taken as the gerundive of an impersonal
 verb, so that the sense be ""the power of generation""--that is, a
 power by which it is generated by some person.
"," Augustine does not mean to say by those words that the
 Son could beget a Son: but that if He did not, it was not because He
 could not, as we shall see later on (Q. 42, A. 6, ad 3).
"," Divine perfection and the total absence of matter in
 God require that there cannot be several Sons in God, as we have
 explained. Wherefore that there are not several Sons is not due to
 any lack of begetting power in the Father.\
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
219,"[I, Q. 42, Art. 1]
","Whether There Is Equality in God?
"," It would seem that equality is not becoming to the
 divine persons. For equality is in relation to things which are one
 in quantity as the Philosopher says (Metaph. v, text 20). But in the
 divine persons there is no quantity, neither continuous intrinsic
 quantity, which we call size, nor continuous extrinsic quantity,
 which we call place and time. Nor can there be equality by reason of
 discrete quantity, because two persons are more than one. Therefore
 equality is not becoming to the divine persons.
"," Further, the divine persons are of one essence, as we have
 said (Q. 39, A. 2). Now essence is signified by way of form. But
 agreement in form makes things to be alike, not to be equal.
 Therefore, we may speak of likeness in the divine persons, but not
 of equality.
"," Further, things wherein there is to be found equality, are
 equal to one another, for equality is reciprocal. But the divine
 persons cannot be said to be equal to one another. For as Augustine
 says (De Trin. vi, 10): ""If an image answers perfectly to that
 whereof it is the image, it may be said to be equal to it; but that
 which it represents cannot be said to be equal to the image."" But the
 Son is the image of the Father; and so the Father is not equal to the
 Son. Therefore equality is not to be found among the divine persons.
"," Further, equality is a relation. But no relation is common to
 the three persons; for the persons are distinct by reason of the
 relations. Therefore equality is not becoming to the divine persons.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," Quantity is twofold. There is quantity of ""bulk"" or
 dimensive quantity, which is to be found only in corporeal things,
 and has, therefore, no place in God. There is also quantity of
 ""virtue,"" which is measured according to the perfection of some
 nature or form: to this sort of quantity we allude when we speak of
 something as being more, or less, hot; forasmuch as it is more or
 less, perfect in heat. Now this virtual quantity is measured firstly
 by its source--that is, by the perfection of that form or nature:
 such is the greatness of spiritual things, just as we speak of great
 heat on account of its intensity and perfection. And so Augustine
 says (De Trin. vi, 18) that ""in things which are great, but not in
 bulk, to be greater is to be better,"" for the more perfect a thing is
 the better it is. Secondly, virtual quantity is measured by the
 effects of the form. Now the first effect of form is being, for
 everything has being by reason of its form. The second effect is
 operation, for every agent acts through its form. Consequently
 virtual quantity is measured both in regard to being and in regard to
 action: in regard to being, forasmuch as things of a more perfect
 nature are of longer duration; and in regard to action, forasmuch as
 things of a more perfect nature are more powerful to act. And so as
 Augustine (Fulgentius, De Fide ad Petrum i) says: ""We understand
 equality to be in the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, inasmuch as no one
 of them either precedes in eternity, or excels in greatness, or
 surpasses in power.""
"," Where we have equality in respect of virtual quantity,
 equality includes likeness and something besides, because it excludes
 excess. For whatever things have a common form may be said to be
 alike, even if they do not participate in that form equally, just as
 the air may be said to be like fire in heat; but they cannot be said
 to be equal if one participates in the form more perfectly than
 another. And because not only is the same nature in both Father and
 Son, but also is it in both in perfect equality, therefore we say not
 only that the Son is like to the Father, in order to exclude the
 error of Eunomius, but also that He is equal to the Father to exclude
 the error of Arius.
"," Equality and likeness in God may be designated in two
 ways--namely, by nouns and by verbs. When designated by nouns,
 equality in the divine persons is mutual, and so is likeness; for the
 Son is equal and like to the Father, and conversely. This is because
 the divine essence is not more the Father's than the Son's.
 Wherefore, just as the Son has the greatness of the Father, and is
 therefore equal to the Father, so the Father has the greatness of the
 Son, and is therefore equal to the Son. But in reference to
 creatures, Dionysius says (Div. Nom. ix): ""Equality and likeness are
 not mutual."" For effects are said to be like their causes, inasmuch
 as they have the form of their causes; but not conversely, for the
 form is principally in the cause, and secondarily in the effect.
"," In the divine persons there is nothing for us to
 consider but the essence which they have in common and the relations
 in which they are distinct. Now equality implies both--namely,
 distinction of persons, for nothing can be said to be equal to
 itself; and unity of essence, since for this reason are the persons
 equal to one another, that they are of the same greatness and
 essence. Now it is clear that the relation of a thing to itself is
 not a real relation. Nor, again, is one relation referred to another
 by a further relation: for when we say that paternity is opposed to
 filiation, opposition is not a relation mediating between paternity
 and filiation. For in both these cases relation would be multiplied
 indefinitely. Therefore equality and likeness in the divine persons
 is not a real relation distinct from the personal relations: but in
 its concept it includes both the relations which distinguish the
 persons, and the unity of essence. For this reason the Master says
 (Sent. i, D, xxxi) that in these ""it is only the terms that are
 relative.""
",,,,,,,,,,,,
220,"[I, Q. 42, Art. 2]
","Whether the Person Proceeding Is Co-eternal with His Principle, As
"," It would seem that the person proceeding is not
 co-eternal with His principle, as the Son with the Father. For Arius
 gives twelve modes of generation. The first mode is like the issue of
 a line from a point; wherein is wanting equality of simplicity. The
 second is like the emission of rays from the sun; wherein is absent
 equality of nature. The third is like the mark or impression made by a
 seal; wherein is wanting consubstantiality and executive power. The
 fourth is the infusion of a good will from God; wherein also
 consubstantiality is wanting. The fifth is the emanation of an
 accident from its subject; but the accident has no subsistence. The
 sixth is the abstraction of a species from matter, as sense receives
 the species from the sensible object; wherein is wanting equality of
 spiritual simplicity. The seventh is the exciting of the will by
 knowledge, which excitation is merely temporal. The eighth is
 transformation, as an image is made of brass; which transformation is
 material. The ninth is motion from a mover; and here again we have
 effect and cause. The tenth is the taking of species from genera; but
 this mode has no place in God, for the Father is not predicated of the
 Son as the genus of a species. The eleventh is the realization of an
 idea [ideatio], as an external coffer arises from the one in the mind.
 The twelfth is birth, as a man is begotten of his father; which
 implies priority and posteriority of time. Thus it is clear that
 equality of nature or of time is absent in every mode whereby one
 thing is from another. So if the Son is from the Father, we must say
 that He is less than the Father, or later than the Father, or both.
"," Further, everything that comes from another has a principle.
 But nothing eternal has a principle. Therefore the Son is not
 eternal; nor is the Holy Ghost.
"," Further, everything which is corrupted ceases to be. Hence
 everything generated begins to be; for the end of generation is
 existence. But the Son is generated by the Father. Therefore He
 begins to exist, and is not co-eternal with the Father.
"," Further, if the Son be begotten by the Father, either He is
 always being begotten, or there is some moment in which He is
 begotten. If He is always being begotten, since, during the process
 of generation, a thing must be imperfect, as appears in successive
 things, which are always in process of becoming, as time and motion,
 it follows that the Son must be always imperfect, which cannot be
 admitted. Thus there is a moment to be assigned for the begetting of
 the Son, and before that moment the Son did not exist.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," As Augustine says (De Verbis Domini, Serm. 38), no mode
 of the procession of any creature perfectly represents the divine
 generation. Hence we need to gather a likeness of it from many of
 these modes, so that what is wanting in one may be somewhat supplied
 from another; and thus it is declared in the council of Ephesus: ""Let
 Splendor tell thee that the co-eternal Son existed always with the
 Father; let the Word announce the impassibility of His birth; let the
 name Son insinuate His consubstantiality."" Yet, above them all the
 procession of the word from the intellect represents it more exactly;
 the intellectual word not being posterior to its source except in an
 intellect passing from potentiality to act; and this cannot be said
 of God.
"," Eternity excludes the principle of duration, but not
 the principle of origin.
"," Every corruption is a change; and so all that corrupts
 begins not to exist and ceases to be. The divine generation, however,
 is not changed, as stated above (Q. 27, A. 2). Hence the Son is ever
 being begotten, and the Father is always begetting.
"," In time there is something indivisible--namely, the
 instant; and there is something else which endures--namely, time. But
 in eternity the indivisible ""now"" stands ever still, as we have said
 above (Q. 10, A. 2, ad 1; A. 4, ad 2). But the generation of the Son
 is not in the ""now"" of time, or in time, but in eternity. And so to
 express the presentiality and permanence of eternity, we can say that
 ""He is ever being born,"" as Origen said (Hom. in Joan. i). But as
 Gregory [*Moral. xxix, 21] and Augustine [*Super Ps. 2:7] said, it is
 better to say ""ever born,"" so that ""ever"" may denote the permanence
 of eternity, and ""born"" the perfection of the only Begotten. Thus,
 therefore, neither is the Son imperfect, nor ""was there a time when
 He was not,"" as Arius said.
",,,,,,,,,,,,
221,"[I, Q. 42, Art. 3]
","Whether in the Divine Persons There Exists an Order of Nature?
"," It would seem that among the divine persons there does
 not exist an order of nature. For whatever exists in God is the
 essence, or a person, or a notion. But the order of nature does not
 signify the essence, nor any of the persons, or notions. Therefore
 there is no order of nature in God.
"," Further, wherever order of nature exists, there one comes
 before another, at least, according to nature and intellect. But in
 the divine persons there exists neither priority nor posteriority, as
 declared by Athanasius. Therefore, in the divine persons there is no
 order of nature.
"," Further, wherever order exists, distinction also exists.
 But there is no distinction in the divine nature. Therefore it is
 not subject to order; and order of nature does not exist in it.
"," Further, the divine nature is the divine essence. But
 there is no order of essence in God. Therefore neither is there
 of nature.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," The order of nature signifies the notion of origin in
 general, not a special kind of origin.
"," In things created, even when what is derived from a
 principle is co-equal in duration with its principle, the principle
 still comes first in the order of nature and reason, if formally
 considered as principle. If, however, we consider the relations of
 cause and effect, or of the principle and the thing proceeding
 therefrom, it is clear that the things so related are simultaneous in
 the order of nature and reason, inasmuch as the one enters the
 definition of the other. But in God the relations themselves are the
 persons subsisting in one nature. So, neither on the part of the
 nature, nor on the part the relations, can one person be prior to
 another, not even in the order of nature and reason.
"," The order of nature means not the ordering of nature
 itself, but the existence of order in the divine Persons according to
 natural origin.
"," Nature in a certain way implies the idea of a
 principle, but essence does not; and so the order of origin is more
 correctly called the order of nature than the order of essence.

222,"[I, Q. 4, Art. 4]
","Whether the Son Is Equal to the Father in Greatness?
"," It would seem that the Son is not equal to the Father in
 greatness. For He Himself said (John 14:28): ""The Father is greater
 than I""; and the Apostle says (1 Cor. 15:28): ""The Son Himself shall
 be subject to Him that put all things under Him.""
"," Further, paternity is part of the Father's dignity. But
 paternity does not belong to the Son. Therefore the Son does not
 possess all the Father's dignity; and so He is not equal in greatness
 to the Father.
"," Further, wherever there exist a whole and a part, many parts
 are more than one only, or than fewer parts; as three men are more
 than two, or than one. But in God a universal whole exists, and a
 part; for under relation or notion, several notions are included.
 Therefore, since in the Father there are three notions, while in the
 Son there are only two, the Son is evidently not equal to the Father.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," These words are to be understood of Christ's human
 nature, wherein He is less than the Father, and subject to Him; but
 in His divine nature He is equal to the Father. This is expressed by
 Athanasius, ""Equal to the Father in His Godhead; less than the Father
 in humanity"": and by Hilary (De Trin. ix): ""By the fact of giving,
 the Father is greater; but He is not less to Whom the same being is
 given""; and (De Synod.): ""The Son subjects Himself by His inborn
 piety""--that is, by His recognition of paternal authority; whereas
 ""creatures are subject by their created weakness.""
"," Equality is measured by greatness. In God greatness
 signifies the perfection of nature, as above explained (A. 1, ad 1),
 and belongs to the essence. Thus equality and likeness in God have
 reference to the essence; nor can there be inequality or
 dissimilitude arising from the distinction of the relations.
 Wherefore Augustine says (Contra Maxim. iii, 13), ""The question of
 origin is, Who is from whom? but the question of equality is, Of what
 kind, or how great, is he?"" Therefore, paternity is the Father's
 dignity, as also the Father's essence: since dignity is something
 absolute, and pertains to the essence. As, therefore, the same
 essence, which in the Father is paternity, in the Son is filiation,
 so the same dignity which, in the Father is paternity, in the Son is
 filiation. It is thus true to say that the Son possesses whatever
 dignity the Father has; but we cannot argue--""the Father has
 paternity, therefore the Son has paternity,"" for there is a
 transition from substance to relation. For the Father and the Son
 have the same essence and dignity, which exist in the Father by the
 relation of giver, and in the Son by relation of receiver.
"," In God relation is not a universal whole, although it
 is predicated of each of the relations; because all the relations are
 one in essence and being, which is irreconcilable with the idea of
 universal, the parts of which are distinguished in being. Person
 likewise is not a universal term in God as we have seen above (Q. 30,
 A. 4). Wherefore all the relations together are not greater than only
 one; nor are all the persons something greater than only one; because
 the whole perfection of the divine nature exists in each person.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
223,"[I, Q. 42, Art. 5]
","Whether the Son Is in the Father, and Conversely?
"," It would seem that the Son and the Father are not in each
 other. For the Philosopher (Phys. iv, text. 23) gives eight modes of
 one thing existing in another, according to none of which is the Son
 in the Father, or conversely; as is patent to anyone who examines each
 mode. Therefore the Son and the Father are not in each other.
"," Further, nothing that has come out from another is within.
 But the Son from eternity came out from the Father, according to Mic.
 5:2: ""His going forth is from the beginning, from the days of
 eternity."" Therefore the Son is not in the Father.
"," Further, one of two opposites cannot be in the other. But the
 Son and the Father are relatively opposed. Therefore one cannot be in
 the other.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," What is contained in creatures does not sufficiently
 represent what exists in God; so according to none of the modes
 enumerated by the Philosopher, are the Son and the Father in each
 other. The mode the most nearly approaching to the reality is to be
 found in that whereby something exists in its originating principle,
 except that the unity of essence between the principle and that which
 proceeds therefrom is wanting in things created.
"," The Son's going forth from the Father is by mode of the
 interior procession whereby the word emerges from the heart and
 remains therein. Hence this going forth in God is only by the
 distinction of the relations, not by any kind of essential separation.
"," The Father and the Son are relatively opposed, but not
 essentially; while, as above explained, one relative opposite is in
 the other.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
224,"[I, Q. 42, Art. 6]
","Whether the Son Is Equal to the Father in Power?
"," It would seem that the Son is not equal to the Father
 in power. For it is said (John 5:19): ""The Son cannot do anything of
 Himself but what He seeth the Father doing."" But the Father can act
 of Himself. Therefore the Father's power is greater than the Son's.
"," Further, greater is the power of him who commands and teaches
 than of him who obeys and hears. But the Father commands the Son
 according to John 14:31: ""As the Father gave Me commandment so do I.""
 The Father also teaches the Son: ""The Father loveth the Son, and
 showeth Him all things that Himself doth"" (John 5:20). Also, the Son
 hears: ""As I hear, so I judge"" (John 5:30). Therefore the Father has
 greater power than the Son.
"," Further, it belongs to the Father's omnipotence to be able to
 beget a Son equal to Himself. For Augustine says (Contra Maxim. iii,
 7), ""Were He unable to beget one equal to Himself, where would be the
 omnipotence of God the Father?"" But the Son cannot beget a Son, as
 proved above (Q. 41, A. 6). Therefore the Son cannot do all that
 belongs to the Father's omnipotence; and hence He is not equal to Him
 power.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The words, ""the Son cannot of Himself do anything,"" do
 not withdraw from the Son any power possessed by the Father, since it
 is immediately added, ""Whatsoever things the Father doth, the Son
 doth in like manner""; but their meaning is to show that the Son
 derives His power from the Father, of Whom He receives His nature.
 Hence, Hilary says (De Trin. ix), ""The unity of the divine nature
 implies that the Son so acts of Himself [per se], that He does not
 act by Himself [a se].""
"," The Father's ""showing"" and the Son's ""hearing"" are to
 be taken in the sense that the Father communicates knowledge to the
 Son, as He communicates His essence. The command of the Father can be
 explained in the same sense, as giving Him from eternity knowledge
 and will to act, by begetting Him. Or, better still, this may be
 referred to Christ in His human nature.
"," As the same essence is paternity in the Father, and
 filiation in the Son: so by the same power the Father begets, and the
 Son is begotten. Hence it is clear that the Son can do whatever the
 Father can do; yet it does not follow that the Son can beget; for to
 argue thus would imply transition from substance to relation, for
 generation signifies a divine relation. So the Son has the same
 omnipotence as the Father, but with another relation; the Father
 possessing power as ""giving"" signified when we say that He is able to
 beget; while the Son possesses the power of ""receiving,"" signified by
 saying that He can be begotten.

225,"[I, Q. 43, Art. 1]
","Whether a Divine Person Can Be Properly Sent?
"," It would seem that a divine person cannot be properly
 sent. For one who is sent is less than the sender. But one divine
 person is not less than another. Therefore one person is not sent by
 another.
"," Further, what is sent is separated from the sender; hence
 Jerome says, commenting on Ezech. 16:53: ""What is joined and tied in
 one body cannot be sent."" But in the divine persons there is nothing
 that is separable, as Hilary says (De Trin. vii). Therefore one
 person is not sent by another.
"," Further, whoever is sent, departs from one place and comes
 anew into another. But this does not apply to a divine person, Who is
 everywhere. Therefore it is not suitable for a divine person to be
 sent.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Mission implies inferiority in the one sent, when it
 means procession from the sender as principle, by command or counsel;
 forasmuch as the one commanding is the greater, and the counsellor is
 the wiser. In God, however, it means only procession of origin, which
 is according to equality, as explained above (Q. 42, AA. 4, 6).
"," What is so sent as to begin to exist where previously
 it did not exist, is locally moved by being sent; hence it is
 necessarily separated locally from the sender. This, however, has no
 place in the mission of a divine person; for the divine person sent
 neither begins to exist where he did not previously exist, nor ceases
 to exist where He was. Hence such a mission takes place without a
 separation, having only distinction of origin.
"," This objection rests on the idea of mission according
 to local motion, which is not in God.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
226,"[I, Q. 43, Art. 2]
","Whether Mission Is Eternal, or Only Temporal?
"," It would seem that mission can be eternal. For Gregory
 says (Hom. xxvi, in Ev.), ""The Son is sent as He is begotten."" But
 the Son's generation is eternal. Therefore mission is eternal.
"," Further, a thing is changed if it becomes something
 temporally. But a divine person is not changed. Therefore the
 mission of a divine person is not temporal, but eternal.
"," Further, mission implies procession. But the procession of
 the divine persons is eternal. Therefore mission is also eternal.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Gregory speaks of the temporal generation of the Son,
 not from the Father, but from His mother; or it may be taken to mean
 that He could be sent because eternally begotten.
"," That a divine person may newly exist in anyone, or be
 possessed by anyone in time, does not come from change of the divine
 person, but from change in the creature; as God Himself is called
 Lord temporally by change of the creature.
"," Mission signifies not only procession from the
 principle, but also determines the temporal term of the procession.
 Hence mission is only temporal. Or we may say that it includes the
 eternal procession, with the addition of a temporal effect. For the
 relation of a divine person to His principle must be eternal. Hence
 the procession may be called a twin procession, eternal and temporal,
 not that there is a double relation to the principle, but a double
 term, temporal and eternal.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
227,"[I, Q. 43, Art. 3]
","Whether the Invisible Mission of the Divine Person Is Only According
"," It would seem that the invisible mission of the divine
 person is not only according to the gift of sanctifying grace. For the
 sending of a divine person means that He is given. Hence if the divine
 person is sent only according to the gift of sanctifying grace, the
 divine person Himself will not be given, but only His gifts; and this
 is the error of those who say that the Holy Ghost is not given, but
 that His gifts are given.
"," Further, this preposition, ""according to,"" denotes the
 habitude of some cause. But the divine person is the cause why the
 gift of sanctifying grace is possessed, and not conversely, according
 to Rom. 5:5, ""the charity of God is poured forth in our hearts by the
 Holy Ghost, Who is given to us."" Therefore it is improperly said that
 the divine person is sent according to the gift of sanctifying grace.
"," Further, Augustine says (De Trin. iv, 20) that ""the Son, when
 temporally perceived by the mind, is sent."" But the Son is known not
 only by sanctifying grace, but also by gratuitous grace, as by faith
 and knowledge. Therefore the divine person is not sent only according
 to the gift of sanctifying grace.
"," Further, Rabanus says that the Holy Ghost was given to the
 apostles for the working of miracles. This, however, is not a gift of
 sanctifying grace, but a gratuitous grace. Therefore the divine
 person is not given only according to the gift of sanctifying grace.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," By the gift of sanctifying grace the rational creature
 is perfected so that it can freely use not only the created gift
 itself, but enjoy also the divine person Himself; and so the
 invisible mission takes place according to the gift of sanctifying
 grace; and yet the divine person Himself is given.
"," Sanctifying grace disposes the soul to possess the
 divine person; and this is signified when it is said that the Holy
 Ghost is given according to the gift of grace. Nevertheless the gift
 itself of grace is from the Holy Ghost; which is meant by the words,
 ""the charity of God is poured forth in our hearts by the Holy Ghost.""
"," Although the Son can be known by us according to other
 effects, yet neither does He dwell in us, nor is He possessed by us
 according to those effects.
"," The working of miracles manifests sanctifying grace as
 also does the gift of prophecy and any other gratuitous graces. Hence
 gratuitous grace is called the ""manifestation of the Spirit"" (1 Cor.
 12:7). So the Holy Ghost is said to be given to the apostles for the
 working of miracles, because sanctifying grace was given to them with
 the outward sign. Were the sign only of sanctifying grace given to
 them without the grace itself, it would not be simply said that the
 Holy Ghost was given, except with some qualifying term; just as we
 read of certain ones receiving the gift of the spirit of prophecy, or
 of miracles, as having from the Holy Ghost the power of prophesying
 or of working miracles.
",,,,,,,,,,,,
228,"[I, Q. 43, Art. 4]
","Whether the Father Can Be Fittingly Sent?
"," It would seem that it is fitting also that the Father
 should be sent. For being sent means that the divine person is given.
 But the Father gives Himself since He can only be possessed by His
 giving Himself. Therefore it can be said that the Father sends
 Himself.
"," Further, the divine person is sent according to the
 indwelling of grace. But by grace the whole Trinity dwells in us
 according to John 14:23: ""We will come to him and make Our abode with
 him."" Therefore each one of the divine persons is sent.
"," Further, whatever belongs to one person, belongs to them all,
 except the notions and persons. But mission does not signify any
 person; nor even a notion, since there are only five notions, as
 stated above (Q. 32, A. 3). Therefore every divine person can be sent.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," In the sense of ""giving"" as a free bestowal of
 something, the Father gives Himself, as freely bestowing Himself to
 be enjoyed by the creature. But as implying the authority of the
 giver as regards what is given, ""to be given"" only applies in God to
 the Person Who is from another; and the same as regards ""being sent.""
"," Although the effect of grace is also from the Father,
 Who dwells in us by grace, just as the Son and the Holy Ghost, still
 He is not described as being sent, for He is not from another. Thus
 Augustine says (De Trin. iv, 20) that ""The Father, when known by
 anyone in time, is not said to be sent; for there is no one whence He
 is, or from whom He proceeds.""
"," Mission, meaning procession from the sender, includes
 the signification of a notion, not of a special notion, but in
 general; thus ""to be from another"" is common to two of the notions.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
229,"[I, Q. 43, Art. 5]
","Whether It Is Fitting for the Son to Be Sent Invisibly?
"," It would seem that it is not fitting for the Son to be
 sent invisibly. For invisible mission of the divine person is
 according to the gift of grace. But all gifts of grace belong to the
 Holy Ghost, according to 1 Cor. 12:11: ""One and the same Spirit
 worketh all things."" Therefore only the Holy Ghost is sent invisibly.
"," Further, the mission of the divine person is according to
 sanctifying grace. But the gifts belonging to the perfection of the
 intellect are not gifts of sanctifying grace, since they can be held
 without the gift of charity, according to 1 Cor. 13:2: ""If I should
 have prophecy, and should know all mysteries, and all knowledge, and
 if I should have all faith so that I could move mountains, and have
 not charity, I am nothing."" Therefore, since the Son proceeds as the
 word of the intellect, it seems unfitting for Him to be sent
 invisibly.
"," Further, the mission of the divine person is a procession, as
 expounded above (AA. 1, 4). But the procession of the Son and of the
 Holy Ghost differ from each other. Therefore they are distinct
 missions if both are sent; and then one of them would be superfluous,
 since one would suffice for the creature's sanctification.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Although all the gifts, considered as such, are
 attributed to the Holy Ghost, forasmuch as He is by His nature the
 first Gift, since He is Love, as stated above (Q. 38, A. 1), some
 gifts nevertheless, by reason of their own particular nature, are
 appropriated in a certain way to the Son, those, namely, which belong
 to the intellect, and in respect of which we speak of the mission of
 the Son. Hence Augustine says (De Trin. iv, 20) that ""The Son is sent
 to anyone invisibly, whenever He is known and perceived by anyone.""
"," The soul is made like to God by grace. Hence for a
 divine person to be sent to anyone by grace, there must needs be a
 likening of the soul to the divine person Who is sent, by some gift
 of grace. Because the Holy Ghost is Love, the soul is assimilated to
 the Holy Ghost by the gift of charity: hence the mission of the Holy
 Ghost is according to the mode of charity. Whereas the Son is the
 Word, not any sort of word, but one Who breathes forth Love. Hence
 Augustine says (De Trin. ix 10): ""The Word we speak of is knowledge
 with love."" Thus the Son is sent not in accordance with every and any
 kind of intellectual perfection, but according to the intellectual
 illumination, which breaks forth into the affection of love, as is
 said (John 6:45): ""Everyone that hath heard from the Father and hath
 learned, cometh to Me,"" and (Ps. 38:4): ""In my meditation a fire
 shall flame forth."" Thus Augustine plainly says (De Trin. iv, 20):
 ""The Son is sent, whenever He is known and perceived by anyone."" Now
 perception implies a certain experimental knowledge; and this is
 properly called wisdom [sapientia], as it were a sweet knowledge
 [sapida scientia], according to Ecclus. 6:23: ""The wisdom of doctrine
 is according to her name.""
"," Since mission implies the origin of the person Who is
 sent, and His indwelling by grace, as above explained (A. 1), if we
 speak of mission according to origin, in this sense the Son's mission
 is distinguished from the mission of the Holy Ghost, as generation is
 distinguished from procession. If we consider mission as regards the
 effect of grace, in this sense the two missions are united in the
 root which is grace, but are distinguished in the effects of grace,
 which consist in the illumination of the intellect and the kindling
 of the affection. Thus it is manifest that one mission cannot be
 without the other, because neither takes place without sanctifying
 grace, nor is one person separated from the other.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
230,"[I, Q. 43, Art. 6]
","Whether the Invisible Mission Is to All Who Participate Grace?
"," It would seem that the invisible mission is not to all
 who participate grace. For the Fathers of the Old Testament had their
 share of grace. Yet to them was made no invisible mission; for it is
 said (John 7:39): ""The Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus was
 not yet glorified."" Therefore the invisible mission is not to all
 partakers in grace.
"," Further, progress in virtue is only by grace. But the
 invisible mission is not according to progress in virtue; because
 progress in virtue is continuous, since charity ever increases or
 decreases; and thus the mission would be continuous. Therefore the
 invisible mission is not to all who share in grace.
"," Further, Christ and the blessed have fullness of grace.
 But mission is not to them, for mission implies distance, whereas
 Christ, as man, and all the blessed are perfectly united to God.
 Therefore the invisible mission is not to all sharers in grace.
"," Further, the Sacraments of the New Law contain grace, and
 it is not said that the invisible mission is sent to them. Therefore
 the invisible mission is not to all that have grace.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," The invisible mission was directed to the Old Testament
 Fathers, as appears from what Augustine says (De Trin. iv, 20), that
 the invisible mission of the Son ""is in man and with men. This was
 done in former times with the Fathers and the Prophets."" Thus the
 words, ""the Spirit was not yet given,"" are to be applied to that
 giving accompanied with a visible sign which took place on the day
 of Pentecost.
"," The invisible mission takes place also as regards
 progress in virtue or increase of grace. Hence Augustine says (De
 Trin. iv, 20), that ""the Son is sent to each one when He is known
 and perceived by anyone, so far as He can be known and perceived
 according to the capacity of the soul, whether journeying towards
 God, or united perfectly to Him."" Such invisible mission, however,
 chiefly occurs as regards anyone's proficiency in the performance of
 a new act, or in the acquisition of a new state of grace; as, for
 example, the proficiency in reference to the gift of miracles or of
 prophecy, or in the fervor of charity leading a man to expose himself
 to the danger of martyrdom, or to renounce his possessions, or to
 undertake any arduous work.
"," The invisible mission is directed to the blessed at the
 very beginning of their beatitude. The invisible mission is made to
 them subsequently, not by ""intensity"" of grace, but by the further
 revelation of mysteries; which goes on till the day of judgment. Such
 an increase is by the ""extension"" of grace, because it extends to a
 greater number of objects. To Christ the invisible mission was sent
 at the first moment of His conception; but not afterwards, since from
 the beginning of His conception He was filled with all wisdom and
 grace.
"," Grace resides instrumentally in the sacraments of the
 New Law, as the form of a thing designed resides in the instruments
 of the art designing, according to a process flowing from the agent
 to the passive object. But mission is only spoken of as directed to
 its term. Hence the mission of the divine person is not sent to the
 sacraments, but to those who receive grace through the sacraments.
",,,,,,,,,,,,
231,"[I, Q. 43, Art. 7]
","Whether It Is Fitting for the Holy Ghost to Be Sent Visibly?
"," It would seem that the Holy Ghost is not fittingly sent
 in a visible manner. For the Son as visibly sent to the world is said
 to be less than the Father. But the Holy Ghost is never said to be
 less than the Father. Therefore the Holy Ghost is not fittingly sent
 in a visible manner.
"," Further, the visible mission takes place by way of union to
 a visible creature, as the Son's mission according to the flesh. But
 the Holy Ghost did not assume any visible creature; and hence it
 cannot be said that He exists otherwise in some creatures than in
 others, unless perhaps as in a sign, as He is also present in the
 sacraments, and in all the figures of the law. Thus the Holy Ghost
 is either not sent visibly at all, or His visible mission takes
 place in all these things.
"," Further, every visible creature is an effect showing forth
 the whole Trinity. Therefore the Holy Ghost is not sent by reason
 of those visible creatures more than any other person.
"," Further, the Son was visibly sent by reason of the noblest
 kind of creature--namely, the human nature. Therefore if the Holy
 Ghost is sent visibly, He ought to be sent by reason of rational
 creatures.
"," Further, whatever is done visibly by God is dispensed by the
 ministry of the angels; as Augustine says (De Trin. iii, 4,5,9). So
 visible appearances, if there have been any, came by means of the
 angels. Thus the angels are sent, and not the Holy Ghost.
"," Further, the Holy Ghost being sent in a visible manner
 is only for the purpose of manifesting the invisible mission; as
 invisible things are made known by the visible. So those to whom the
 invisible mission was not sent, ought not to receive the visible
 mission; and to all who received the invisible mission, whether in
 the New or in the Old Testament, the visible mission ought likewise
 to be sent; and this is clearly false. Therefore the Holy Ghost is
 not sent visibly.
",,,,,,,,,,,," The Son assumed the visible creature, wherein He
 appeared, into the unity of His person, so that whatever can be said
 of that creature can be said of the Son of God; and so, by reason of
 the nature assumed, the Son is called less than the Father. But the
 Holy Ghost did not assume the visible creature, in which He appeared,
 into the unity of His person; so that what is said of it cannot be
 predicated of Him. Hence He cannot be called less than the Father by
 reason of any visible creature.
"," The visible mission of the Holy Ghost does not apply to
 the imaginary vision which is that of prophecy; because as Augustine
 says (De Trin. ii, 6): ""The prophetic vision is not displayed to
 corporeal eyes by corporeal shapes, but is shown in the spirit by the
 spiritual images of bodies. But whoever saw the dove and the fire,
 saw them by their eyes. Nor, again, has the Holy Ghost the same
 relation to these images that the Son has to the rock, because it is
 said, 'The rock was Christ' (1 Cor. 10:4). For that rock was already
 created, and after the manner of an action was named Christ, Whom it
 typified; whereas the dove and the fire suddenly appeared to signify
 only what was happening. They seem, however, to be like to the flame
 of the burning bush seen by Moses and to the column which the people
 followed in the desert, and to the lightning and thunder issuing
 forth when the law was given on the mountain. For the purpose of the
 bodily appearances of those things was that they might signify, and
 then pass away."" Thus the visible mission is neither displayed by
 prophetic vision, which belongs to the imagination, and not to the
 body, nor by the sacramental signs of the Old and New Testament,
 wherein certain pre-existing things are employed to signify
 something. But the Holy Ghost is said to be sent visibly, inasmuch as
 He showed Himself in certain creatures as in signs especially made
 for that purpose.
"," Although the whole Trinity makes those creatures, still
 they are made in order to show forth in some special way this or that
 person. For as the Father, Son and Holy Ghost are signified by
 diverse names, so also can They each one be signified by different
 things; although neither separation nor diversity exists amongst Them.
"," It was necessary for the Son to be declared as the
 author of sanctification, as explained above. Thus the visible
 mission of the Son was necessarily made according to the rational
 nature to which it belongs to act, and which is capable of
 sanctification; whereas any other creature could be the sign of
 sanctification. Nor was such a visible creature, formed for such a
 purpose, necessarily assumed by the Holy Ghost into the unity of His
 person, since it was not assumed or used for the purpose of action,
 but only for the purpose of a sign; and so likewise it was not
 required to last beyond what its use required.
"," Those visible creatures were formed by the ministry of
 the angels, not to signify the person of an angel, but to signify the
 Person of the Holy Ghost. Thus, as the Holy Ghost resided in those
 visible creatures as the one signified in the sign, on that account
 the Holy Ghost is said to be sent visibly, and not as an angel.
"," It is not necessary that the invisible mission should
 always be made manifest by some visible external sign; but, as is
 said (1 Cor. 12:7)--""the manifestation of the Spirit is given to
 every man unto profit""--that is, of the Church. This utility consists
 in the confirmation and propagation of the faith by such visible
 signs. This has been done chiefly by Christ and by the apostles,
 according to Heb. 2:3, ""which having begun to be declared by the
 Lord, was confirmed unto us by them that heard.""

232,"[I, Q. 43, Art. 8]
","Whether a Divine Person Is Sent Only by the Person Whence He Proceeds
"," It would seem that a divine person is sent only by the
 one whence He proceeds eternally. For as Augustine says (De Trin. iv),
 ""The Father is sent by no one because He is from no one."" Therefore if
 a divine person is sent by another, He must be from that other.
"," Further, the sender has authority over the one sent. But
 there can be no authority as regards a divine person except from
 origin. Therefore the divine person sent must proceed from the one
 sending.
"," Further, if a divine person can be sent by one whence He does
 not proceed, then the Holy Ghost may be given by a man, although He
 proceeds not from him; which is contrary to what Augustine says (De
 Trin. xv). Therefore the divine person is sent only by the one whence
 He proceeds.

233,"[I, Q. 44, Art. 1]
","Whether It Is Necessary That Every Being Be Created by God?
"," It would seem that it is not necessary that every being
 be created by God. For there is nothing to prevent a thing from being
 without that which does not belong to its essence, as a man can be
 found without whiteness. But the relation of the thing caused to its
 cause does not appear to be essential to beings, for some beings can
 be understood without it; therefore they can exist without it; and
 therefore it is possible that some beings should not be created by
 God.
"," Further, a thing requires an efficient cause in order to
 exist. Therefore whatever cannot but exist does not require an
 efficient cause. But no necessary thing can not exist, because
 whatever necessarily exists cannot but exist. Therefore as there are
 many necessary things in existence, it appears that not all beings are
 from God.
"," Further, whatever things have a cause, can be demonstrated
 by that cause. But in mathematics demonstration is not made by the
 efficient cause, as appears from the Philosopher (Metaph. iii, text
 3); therefore not all beings are from God as from their efficient
 cause.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Though the relation to its cause is not part of the
 definition of a thing caused, still it follows, as a consequence, on
 what belongs to its essence; because from the fact that a thing has
 being by participation, it follows that it is caused. Hence such a
 being cannot be without being caused, just as man cannot be without
 having the faculty of laughing. But, since to be caused does not
 enter into the essence of being as such, therefore is it possible for
 us to find a being uncaused.
"," This objection has led some to say that what is
 necessary has no cause (Phys. viii, text 46). But this is manifestly
 false in the demonstrative sciences, where necessary principles are
 the causes of necessary conclusions. And therefore Aristotle says
 (Metaph. v, text 6), that there are some necessary things which have
 a cause of their necessity. But the reason why an efficient cause is
 required is not merely because the effect is not necessary, but
 because the effect might not be if the cause were not. For this
 conditional proposition is true, whether the antecedent and
 consequent be possible or impossible.
"," The science of mathematics treats its object as though
 it were something abstracted mentally, whereas it is not abstract in
 reality. Now, it is becoming that everything should have an efficient
 cause in proportion to its being. And so, although the object of
 mathematics has an efficient cause, still, its relation to that cause
 is not the reason why it is brought under the consideration of the
 mathematician, who therefore does not demonstrate that object from
 its efficient cause.

","Whether Primary Matter Is Created by God?
"," It would seem that primary matter is not created by God.
 For whatever is made is composed of a subject and of something else
 (Phys. i, text 62). But primary matter has no subject. Therefore
 primary matter cannot have been made by God.
"," Further, action and passion are opposite members of a
 division. But as the first active principle is God, so the first
 passive principle is matter. Therefore God and primary matter are two
 principles divided against each other, neither of which is from the
 other.
"," Further, every agent produces its like, and thus, since
 every agent acts in proportion to its actuality, it follows that
 everything made is in some degree actual. But primary matter is only
 in potentiality, formally considered in itself. Therefore it is
 against the nature of primary matter to be a thing made.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The Philosopher (Phys. i, text 62), is speaking of
 ""becoming"" in particular--that is, from form to form, either
 accidental or substantial. But here we are speaking of things
 according to their emanation from the universal principle of being;
 from which emanation matter itself is not excluded, although it is
 excluded from the former mode of being made.
"," Passion is an effect of action. Hence it is reasonable
 that the first passive principle should be the effect of the first
 active principle, since every imperfect thing is caused by one
 perfect. For the first principle must be most perfect, as Aristotle
 says (Metaph. xii, text 40).
"," The reason adduced does not show that matter is not
 created, but that it is not created without form; for though
 everything created is actual, still it is not pure act. Hence it is
 necessary that even what is potential in it should be created, if all
 that belongs to its being is created.

235,"[I, Q. 44, Art. 3]
","Whether the Exemplar Cause Is Anything Besides God?
"," It would seem that the exemplar cause is something
 besides God. For the effect is like its exemplar cause. But creatures
 are far from being like God. Therefore God is not their exemplar
 cause.
"," Further, whatever is by participation is reduced to something
 self-existing, as a thing ignited is reduced to fire, as stated above
 (A. 1). But whatever exists in sensible things exists only by
 participation of some species. This appears from the fact that in all
 sensible species is found not only what belongs to the species, but
 also individuating principles added to the principles of the species.
 Therefore it is necessary to admit self-existing species, as for
 instance, a per se man, and a per se horse, and the like, which
 are called the exemplars. Therefore exemplar causes exist besides God.
"," Further, sciences and definitions are concerned with species
 themselves, but not as these are in particular things, because there
 is no science or definition of particular things. Therefore there are
 some beings, which are beings or species not existing in singular
 things, and these are called exemplars. Therefore the same conclusion
 follows as above.
"," Further, this likewise appears from Dionysius, who says (Div.
 Nom. v) that self-subsisting being is before self-subsisting life,
 and before self-subsisting wisdom.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," Although creatures do not attain to a natural likeness
 to God according to similitude of species, as a man begotten is like
 to the man begetting, still they do attain to likeness to Him,
 forasmuch as they represent the divine idea, as a material house is
 like to the house in the architect's mind.
"," It is of a man's nature to be in matter, and so a man
 without matter is impossible. Therefore although this particular man
 is a man by participation of the species, he cannot be reduced to
 anything self-existing in the same species, but to a superior
 species, such as separate substances. The same applies to other
 sensible things.
"," Although every science and definition is concerned only
 with beings, still it is not necessary that a thing should have the
 same mode in reality as the thought of it has in our understanding.
 For we abstract universal ideas by force of the active intellect from
 the particular conditions; but it is not necessary that the
 universals should exist outside the particulars in order to be their
 exemplars.
"," As Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv), by ""self-existing
 life and self-existing wisdom"" he sometimes denotes God Himself,
 sometimes the powers given to things themselves; but not any
 self-subsisting things, as the ancients asserted.

236,"[I, Q. 44, Art. 4]
","Whether God Is the Final Cause of All Things?
"," It would seem that God is not the final cause of all
 things. For to act for an end seems to imply need of the end. But God
 needs nothing. Therefore it does not become Him to act for an end.
"," Further, the end of generation, and the form of the thing
 generated, and the agent cannot be identical (Phys. ii, text 70),
 because the end of generation is the form of the thing generated. But
 God is the first agent producing all things. Therefore He is not the
 final cause of all things.
"," Further, all things desire their end. But all things do not
 desire God, for all do not even know Him. Therefore God is not the
 end of all things.
"," Further, the final cause is the first of causes. If,
 therefore, God is the efficient cause and the final cause, it
 follows that before and after exist in Him; which is impossible.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," To act from need belongs only to an imperfect agent,
 which by its nature is both agent and patient. But this does not
 belong to God, and therefore He alone is the most perfectly liberal
 giver, because He does not act for His own profit, but only for His
 own goodness.
"," The form of the thing generated is not the end of
 generation, except inasmuch as it is the likeness of the form of the
 generator, which intends to communicate its own likeness; otherwise
 the form of the thing generated would be more noble than the
 generator, since the end is more noble than the means to the end.
"," All things desire God as their end, when they desire
 some good thing, whether this desire be intellectual or sensible, or
 natural, i.e. without knowledge; because nothing is good and
 desirable except forasmuch as it participates in the likeness to God.
"," Since God is the efficient, the exemplar and the final
 cause of all things, and since primary matter is from Him, it follows
 that the first principle of all things is one in reality. But this
 does not prevent us from mentally considering many things in Him,
 some of which come into our mind before others.

237,"[I, Q. 45, Art. 1]
","Whether to Create Is to Make Something from Nothing?
"," It would seem that to create is not to make anything
 from nothing. For Augustine says (Contra Adv. Leg. et Proph. i): ""To
 make concerns what did not exist at all; but to create is to make
 something by bringing forth something from what was already.""
"," Further, the nobility of action and of motion is considered
 from their terms. Action is therefore nobler from good to good, and
 from being to being, than from nothing to something. But creation
 appears to be the most noble action, and first among all actions.
 Therefore it is not from nothing to something, but rather from being
 to being.
"," Further, the preposition ""from"" [ex] imports relation of some
 cause, and especially of the material cause; as when we say that a
 statue is made from brass. But ""nothing"" cannot be the matter of
 being, nor in any way its cause. Therefore to create is not to make
 something from nothing.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Augustine uses the word creation in an equivocal sense,
 according as to be created signifies improvement in things; as when
 we say that a bishop is created. We do not, however, speak of
 creation in that way here, but as it is described above.
"," Changes receive species and dignity, not from the term
 wherefrom, but from the term whereto. Therefore a change is more
 perfect and excellent when the term whereto of the change is more
 noble and excellent, although the term wherefrom, corresponding to
 the term whereto, may be more imperfect: thus generation is simply
 nobler and more excellent than alteration, because the substantial
 form is nobler than the accidental form; and yet the privation of the
 substantial form, which is the term wherefrom in generation, is
 more imperfect than the contrary, which is the term wherefrom in
 alteration. Similarly creation is more perfect and excellent than
 generation and alteration, because the term whereto is the whole
 substance of the thing; whereas what is understood as the term
 wherefrom is simply not-being.
"," When anything is said to be made from nothing, this
 preposition ""from"" [ex] does not signify the material cause, but only
 order; as when we say, ""from morning comes midday""--i.e. after
 morning is midday. But we must understand that this preposition
 ""from"" [ex] can comprise the negation implied when I say the word
 ""nothing,"" or can be included in it. If taken in the first sense,
 then we affirm the order by stating the relation between what is now
 and its previous non-existence. But if the negation includes the
 preposition, then the order is denied, and the sense is, ""It is made
 from nothing--i.e. it is not made from anything""--as if we were to
 say, ""He speaks of nothing,"" because he does not speak of anything.
 And this is verified in both ways, when it is said, that anything is
 made from nothing. But in the first way this preposition ""from"" [ex]
 implies order, as has been said in this reply. In the second sense,
 it imports the material cause, which is denied.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
238,"[I, Q. 45, Art. 2]
","Whether God Can Create Anything?
"," It would seem that God cannot create anything, because,
 according to the Philosopher (Phys. i, text 34), the ancient
 philosophers considered it as a commonly received axiom that ""nothing
 is made from nothing."" But the power of God does not extend to the
 contraries of first principles; as, for instance, that God could make
 the whole to be less than its part, or that affirmation and negation
 are both true at the same time. Therefore God cannot make anything
 from nothing, or create.
"," Further, if to create is to make something from nothing, to
 be created is to be made. But to be made is to be changed. Therefore
 creation is change. But every change occurs in some subject, as
 appears by the definition of movement: for movement is the act of
 what is in potentiality. Therefore it is impossible for anything to
 be made out of nothing by God.
"," Further, what has been made must have at some time been
 becoming. But it cannot be said that what is created, at the same
 time, is becoming and has been made, because in permanent things what
 is becoming, is not, and what has been made, already is: and so it
 would follow that something would be, and not be, at the same time.
 Therefore when anything is made, its becoming precedes its having
 been made. But this is impossible, unless there is a subject in which
 the becoming is sustained. Therefore it is impossible that anything
 should be made from nothing.
"," Further, infinite distance cannot be crossed. But infinite
 distance exists between being and nothing. Therefore it does not
 happen that something is made from nothing.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," Ancient philosophers, as is said above (Q. 44, A. 2),
 considered only the emanation of particular effects from particular
 causes, which necessarily presuppose something in their action;
 whence came their common opinion that ""nothing is made from nothing.""
 But this has no place in the first emanation from the universal
 principle of things.
"," Creation is not change, except according to a mode of
 understanding. For change means that the same something should be
 different now from what it was previously. Sometimes, indeed, the
 same actual thing is different now from what it was before, as in
 motion according to quantity, quality and place; but sometimes it is
 the same being only in potentiality, as in substantial change, the
 subject of which is matter. But in creation, by which the whole
 substance of a thing is produced, the same thing can be taken as
 different now and before only according to our way of understanding,
 so that a thing is understood as first not existing at all, and
 afterwards as existing. But as action and passion coincide as to the
 substance of motion, and differ only according to diverse relations
 (Phys. iii, text 20, 21), it must follow that when motion is
 withdrawn, only diverse relations remain in the Creator and in the
 creature. But because the mode of signification follows the mode of
 understanding as was said above (Q. 13, A. 1), creation is signified
 by mode of change; and on this account it is said that to create is
 to make something from nothing. And yet ""to make"" and ""to be made""
 are more suitable expressions here than ""to change"" and ""to be
 changed,"" because ""to make"" and ""to be made"" import a relation of
 cause to the effect, and of effect to the cause, and imply change
 only as a consequence.
"," In things which are made without movement, to become
 and to be already made are simultaneous, whether such making is the
 term of movement, as illumination (for a thing is being illuminated
 and is illuminated at the same time) or whether it is not the term of
 movement, as the word is being made in the mind and is made at the
 same time. In these things what is being made, is; but when we speak
 of its being made, we mean that it is from another, and was not
 previously. Hence since creation is without movement, a thing is
 being created and is already created at the same time.
"," This objection proceeds from a false imagination, as if
 there were an infinite medium between nothing and being; which is
 plainly false. This false imagination comes from creation being taken
 to signify a change existing between two forms.
",,,,,,,,,,,,
239,"[I, Q. 45, Art. 3]
","Whether Creation Is Anything in the Creature?
"," It would seem that creation is not anything in the
 creature. For as creation taken in a passive sense is attributed to
 the creature, so creation taken in an active sense is attributed to
 the Creator. But creation taken actively is not anything in the
 Creator, because otherwise it would follow that in God there would be
 something temporal. Therefore creation taken passively is not anything
 in the creature.
"," Further, there is no medium between the Creator and the
 creature. But creation is signified as the medium between them both:
 since it is not the Creator, as it is not eternal; nor is it the
 creature, because in that case it would be necessary for the same
 reason to suppose another creation to create it, and so on to
 infinity. Therefore creation is not anything in the creature.
"," Further, if creation is anything besides the created
 substance, it must be an accident belonging to it. But every accident
 is in a subject. Therefore a thing created would be the subject of
 creation, and so the same thing would be the subject and also the term
 of creation. This is impossible, because the subject is before the
 accident, and preserves the accident; while the term is after the
 action and passion whose term it is, and as soon as it exists, action
 and passion cease. Therefore creation itself is not any thing.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Creation signified actively means the divine action,
 which is God's essence, with a relation to the creature. But in God
 relation to the creature is not a real relation, but only a relation
 of reason; whereas the relation of the creature to God is a real
 relation, as was said above (Q. 13, A. 7) in treating of the divine
 names.
"," Because creation is signified as a change, as was said
 above (A. 2, ad 2), and change is a kind of medium between the mover
 and the moved, therefore also creation is signified as a medium
 between the Creator and the creature. Nevertheless passive creation
 is in the creature, and is a creature. Nor is there need of a further
 creation in its creation; because relations, or their entire nature
 being referred to something, are not referred by any other relations,
 but by themselves; as was also shown above (Q. 42, A. 1, ad 4), in
 treating of the equality of the Persons.
"," The creature is the term of creation as signifying a
 change, but is the subject of creation, taken as a real relation, and
 is prior to it in being, as the subject is to the accident.
 Nevertheless creation has a certain aspect of priority on the part of
 the object to which it is directed, which is the beginning of the
 creature. Nor is it necessary that as long as the creature is it
 should be created; because creation imports a relation of the
 creature to the Creator, with a certain newness or beginning.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
240,"[I, Q. 45, Art. 4]
","Whether to Be Created Belongs to Composite and Subsisting Things?
"," It would seem that to be created does not belong to
 composite and subsisting things. For in the book, De Causis (prop.
 iv) it is said, ""The first of creatures is being."" But the being of a
 thing created is not subsisting. Therefore creation properly speaking
 does not belong to subsisting and composite things.
"," Further, whatever is created is from nothing. But composite
 things are not from nothing, but are the result of their own
 component parts. Therefore composite things are not created.
"," Further, what is presupposed in the second emanation is
 properly produced by the first: as natural generation produces the
 natural thing, which is presupposed in the operation of art. But the
 thing supposed in natural generation is matter. Therefore matter,
 and not the composite, is, properly speaking, that which is created.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," In the proposition ""the first of created things is
 being,"" the word ""being"" does not refer to the subject of creation,
 but to the proper concept of the object of creation. For a created
 thing is called created because it is a being, not because it is
 ""this"" being, since creation is the emanation of all being from the
 Universal Being, as was said above (A. 1). We use a similar way of
 speaking when we say that ""the first visible thing is color,""
 although, strictly speaking, the thing colored is what is seen.
"," Creation does not mean the building up of a composite
 thing from pre-existing principles; but it means that the ""composite""
 is created so that it is brought into being at the same time with all
 its principles.
"," This reason does not prove that matter alone is
 created, but that matter does not exist except by creation; for
 creation is the production of the whole being, and not only matter.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
241,"[I, Q. 45, Art. 5]
","Whether It Belongs to God Alone to Create?
"," It would seem that it does not belong to God alone to
 create, because, according to the Philosopher (De Anima ii, text 34),
 what is perfect can make its own likeness. But immaterial creatures
 are more perfect than material creatures, which nevertheless can make
 their own likeness, for fire generates fire, and man begets man.
 Therefore an immaterial substance can make a substance like to itself.
 But immaterial substance can be made only by creation, since it has no
 matter from which to be made. Therefore a creature can create.
"," Further, the greater the resistance is on the part of the
 thing made, so much the greater power is required in the maker. But
 a ""contrary"" resists more than ""nothing."" Therefore it requires more
 power to make (something) from its contrary, which nevertheless a
 creature can do, than to make a thing from nothing. Much more
 therefore can a creature do this.
"," Further, the power of the maker is considered according to
 the measure of what is made. But created being is finite, as we
 proved above when treating of the infinity of God (Q. 7, AA. 2, 3,
 4). Therefore only a finite power is needed to produce a creature by
 creation. But to have a finite power is not contrary to the nature of
 a creature. Therefore it is not impossible for a creature to create.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," A perfect thing participating any nature, makes a
 likeness to itself, not by absolutely producing that nature, but by
 applying it to something else. For an individual man cannot be the
 cause of human nature absolutely, because he would then be the cause
 of himself; but he is the cause of human nature being in the man
 begotten; and thus he presupposes in his action a determinate matter
 whereby he is an individual man. But as an individual man
 participates human nature, so every created being participates, so to
 speak, the nature of being; for God alone is His own being, as we
 have said above (Q. 7, AA. 1, 2). Therefore no created being can
 produce a being absolutely, except forasmuch as it causes ""being"" in
 ""this"": and so it is necessary to presuppose that whereby a thing is
 this thing, before the action whereby it makes its own likeness. But
 in an immaterial substance it is not possible to presuppose anything
 whereby it is this thing; because it is what it is by its form,
 whereby it has being, since it is a subsisting form. Therefore an
 immaterial substance cannot produce another immaterial substance like
 to itself as regards its being, but only as regards some added
 perfection; as we may say that a superior angel illuminates an
 inferior, as Dionysius says (Coel. Hier. iv, x). In this way even in
 heaven there is paternity, as the Apostle says (Eph. 3:15): ""From
 whom all paternity in heaven and on earth is named."" From which
 evidently appears that no created being can cause anything, unless
 something is presupposed; which is against the very idea of creation.
"," A thing is made from its contrary indirectly (Phys. i,
 text 43), but directly from the subject which is in potentiality. And
 so the contrary resists the agent, inasmuch as it impedes the
 potentiality from the act which the agent intends to induce, as fire
 intends to reduce the matter of water to an act like to itself, but
 is impeded by the form and contrary dispositions, whereby the
 potentiality (of the water) is restrained from being reduced to act;
 and the more the potentiality is restrained, the more power is
 required in the agent to reduce the matter to act. Hence a much
 greater power is required in the agent when no potentiality
 pre-exists. Thus therefore it appears that it is an act of much
 greater power to make a thing from nothing, than from its contrary.
"," The power of the maker is reckoned not only from the
 substance of the thing made, but also from the mode of its being
 made; for a greater heat heats not only more, but quicker. Therefore
 although to create a finite effect does not show an infinite power,
 yet to create it from nothing does show an infinite power: which
 appears from what has been said (ad 2). For if a greater power is
 required in the agent in proportion to the distance of the
 potentiality from the act, it follows that the power of that which
 produces something from no presupposed potentiality is infinite,
 because there is no proportion between ""no potentiality"" and the
 potentiality presupposed by the power of a natural agent, as there is
 no proportion between ""not being"" and ""being."" And because no
 creature has simply an infinite power, any more than it has an
 infinite being, as was proved above (Q. 7, A. 2), it follows that no
 creature can create.

242,"[I, Q. 45, Art. 6]
","Whether to Create Is Proper to Any Person?
"," It would seem that to create is proper to some Person.
 For what comes first is the cause of what is after; and what is
 perfect is the cause of what is imperfect. But the procession of the
 divine Person is prior to the procession of the creature: and is more
 perfect, because the divine Person proceeds in perfect similitude of
 its principle; whereas the creature proceeds in imperfect similitude.
 Therefore the processions of the divine Persons are the cause of the
 processions of things, and so to create belongs to a Person.
"," Further, the divine Persons are distinguished from each
 other only by their processions and relations. Therefore whatever
 difference is attributed to the divine Persons belongs to them
 according to the processions and relations of the Persons. But the
 causation of creatures is diversely attributed to the divine Persons;
 for in the Creed, to the Father is attributed that ""He is the Creator
 of all things visible and invisible""; to the Son is attributed that by
 Him ""all things were made""; and to the Holy Ghost is attributed that
 He is ""Lord and Life-giver."" Therefore the causation of creatures
 belongs to the Persons according to processions and relations.
"," Further, if it be said that the causation of the creature
 flows from some essential attribute appropriated to some one Person,
 this does not appear to be sufficient; because every divine effect
 is caused by every essential attribute--viz. by power, goodness and
 wisdom--and thus does not belong to one more than to another.
 Therefore any determinate mode of causation ought not to be attributed
 to one Person more than to another, unless they are distinguished in
 creating according to relations and processions.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The processions of the divine Persons are the cause of
 creation, as above explained.
"," As the divine nature, although common to the three
 Persons, still belongs to them in a kind of order, inasmuch as the
 Son receives the divine nature from the Father, and the Holy Ghost
 from both: so also likewise the power of creation, whilst common to
 the three Persons, belongs to them in a kind of order. For the Son
 receives it from the Father, and the Holy Ghost from both. Hence to
 be the Creator is attributed to the Father as to Him Who does not
 receive the power of creation from another. And of the Son it is said
 (John 1:3), ""Through Him all things were made,"" inasmuch as He has
 the same power, but from another; for this preposition ""through""
 usually denotes a mediate cause, or ""a principle from a principle.""
 But to the Holy Ghost, Who has the same power from both, is
 attributed that by His sway He governs, and quickens what is created
 by the Father through the Son. Again, the reason for this particular
 appropriation may be taken from the common notion of the
 appropriation of the essential attributes. For, as above stated (Q.
 39, A. 8, ad 3), to the Father is appropriated power which is chiefly
 shown in creation, and therefore it is attributed to Him to be the
 Creator. To the Son is appropriated wisdom, through which the
 intellectual agent acts; and therefore it is said: ""Through Whom all
 things were made."" And to the Holy Ghost is appropriated goodness, to
 which belong both government, which brings things to their proper
 end, and the giving of life--for life consists in a certain interior
 movement; and the first mover is the end, and goodness.
"," Although every effect of God proceeds from each
 attribute, each effect is reduced to that attribute with which it is
 naturally connected; thus the order of things is reduced to ""wisdom,""
 and the justification of the sinner to ""mercy"" and ""goodness"" poured
 out super-abundantly. But creation, which is the production of the
 very substance of a thing, is reduced to ""power.""

","Whether in Creatures Is Necessarily Found a Trace of the Trinity?
"," It would seem that in creatures there is not necessarily
 found a trace of the Trinity. For anything can be traced through its
 traces. But the trinity of persons cannot be traced from the
 creatures, as was above stated (Q. 32, A. 1). Therefore there is no
 trace of the Trinity in creatures.
"," Further, whatever is in creatures is created. Therefore if
 the trace of the Trinity is found in creatures according to some of
 their properties, and if everything created has a trace of the
 Trinity, it follows that we can find a trace of the Trinity in each
 of these (properties): and so on to infinitude.
"," Further, the effect represents only its own cause. But the
 causality of creatures belongs to the common nature, and not to the
 relations whereby the Persons are distinguished and numbered.
 Therefore in the creature is to be found a trace not of the Trinity
 but of the unity of essence.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The representation of the trace is to be referred to
 the appropriations: in which manner we are able to arrive at a
 knowledge of the trinity of the divine persons from creatures, as we
 have said (Q. 32, A. 1).
"," A creature properly speaking is a thing
 self-subsisting; and in such are the three above-mentioned things to
 be found. Nor is it necessary that these three things should be found
 in all that exists in the creature; but only to a subsisting being is
 the trace ascribed in regard to those three things.
"," The processions of the persons are also in some way the
 cause and type of creation; as appears from the above (A. 6).
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
244,"[I, Q. 45, Art. 8]
","Whether Creation Is Mingled with Works of Nature and Art?
"," It would seem that creation is mingled in works of
 nature and art. For in every operation of nature and art some form is
 produced. But it is not produced from anything, since matter has no
 part in it. Therefore it is produced from nothing; and thus in every
 operation of nature and art there is creation.
"," Further, the effect is not more powerful than its cause. But
 in natural things the only agent is the accidental form, which is an
 active or a passive form. Therefore the substantial form is not
 produced by the operation of nature; and therefore it must be
 produced by creation.
"," Further, in nature like begets like. But some things are
 found generated in nature by a thing unlike to them; as is evident in
 animals generated through putrefaction. Therefore the form of these
 is not from nature, but by creation; and the same reason applies to
 other things.
"," Further, what is not created, is not a creature. If therefore
 in nature's productions there were not creation, it would follow that
 nature's productions are not creatures; which is heretical.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," Forms begin to be actual when the composite things are
 made, not as though they were made ""directly,"" but only ""indirectly.""
"," The active qualities in nature act by virtue of
 substantial forms: and therefore the natural agent not only produces
 its like according to quality, but according to species.
"," For the generation of imperfect animals, a universal
 agent suffices, and this is to be found in the celestial power to
 which they are assimilated, not in species, but according to a kind
 of analogy. Nor is it necessary to say that their forms are created
 by a separate agent. However, for the generation of perfect animals
 the universal agent does not suffice, but a proper agent is required,
 in the shape of a univocal generator.
"," The operation of nature takes place only on the
 presupposition of created principles; and thus the products of nature
 are called creatures.
",,,,,,,,,,,,
245,"[I, Q. 46, Art. 1]
","Whether the Universe of Creatures Always Existed?
"," It would seem that the universe of creatures, called the
 world, had no beginning, but existed from eternity. For everything
 which begins to exist, is a possible being before it exists: otherwise
 it would be impossible for it to exist. If therefore the world began
 to exist, it was a possible being before it began to exist. But
 possible being is matter, which is in potentiality to existence,
 which results from a form, and to non-existence, which results from
 privation of form. If therefore the world began to exist, matter must
 have existed before the world. But matter cannot exist without form:
 while the matter of the world with its form is the world. Therefore
 the world existed before it began to exist: which is impossible.
"," Further, nothing which has power to be always, sometimes is
 and sometimes is not; because so far as the power of a thing extends
 so long it exists. But every incorruptible thing has power to be
 always; for its power does not extend to any determinate time.
 Therefore no incorruptible thing sometimes is, and sometimes is not:
 but everything which has a beginning at some time is, and at some
 time is not; therefore no incorruptible thing begins to exist. But
 there are many incorruptible things in the world, as the celestial
 bodies and all intellectual substances. Therefore the world did not
 begin to exist.
"," Further, what is unbegotten has no beginning. But the
 Philosopher (Phys. i, text 82) proves that matter is unbegotten, and
 also (De Coelo et Mundo i, text 20) that the heaven is unbegotten.
 Therefore the universe did not begin to exist.
"," Further, a vacuum is where there is not a body, but there
 might be. But if the world began to exist, there was first no body
 where the body of the world now is; and yet it could be there,
 otherwise it would not be there now. Therefore before the world
 there was a vacuum; which is impossible.
"," Further, nothing begins anew to be moved except through
 either the mover or the thing moved being otherwise than it was
 before. But what is otherwise now than it was before, is moved.
 Therefore before every new movement there was a previous movement.
 Therefore movement always was; and therefore also the thing moved
 always was, because movement is only in a movable thing.
"," Further, every mover is either natural or voluntary. But
 neither begins to move except by some pre-existing movement. For
 nature always moves in the same manner: hence unless some change
 precede either in the nature of the mover, or in the movable thing,
 there cannot arise from the natural mover a movement which was not
 there before. And the will, without itself being changed, puts off
 doing what it proposes to do; but this can be only by some imagined
 change, at least on the part of time. Thus he who wills to make a
 house tomorrow, and not today, awaits something which will be
 tomorrow, but is not today; and at least awaits for today to pass,
 and for tomorrow to come; and this cannot be without change, because
 time is the measure of movement. Therefore it remains that before
 every new movement, there was a previous movement; and so the same
 conclusion follows as before.
"," Further, whatever is always in its beginning, and always in
 its end, cannot cease and cannot begin; because what begins is not in
 its end, and what ceases is not in its beginning. But time always is
 in its beginning and end, because there is no time except ""now"" which
 is the end of the past and the beginning of the future. Therefore
 time cannot begin or end, and consequently neither can movement, the
 measure of what is time.
"," Further, God is before the world either in the order of
 nature only, or also by duration. If in the order of nature only,
 therefore, since God is eternal, the world also is eternal. But if
 God is prior by duration; since what is prior and posterior in
 duration constitutes time, it follows that time existed before the
 world, which is impossible.
"," Further, if there is a sufficient cause, there is an effect;
 for a cause to which there is no effect is an imperfect cause,
 requiring something else to make the effect follow. But God is the
 sufficient cause of the world; being the final cause, by reason of
 His goodness, the exemplar cause by reason of His wisdom, and the
 efficient cause, by reason of His power as appears from the above (Q.
 44, AA. 2, 3, 4). Since therefore God is eternal, the world is also
 eternal.
"," Further, eternal action postulates an eternal effect. But
 the action of God is His substance, which is eternal. Therefore the
 world is eternal.
",,,,,,,," Before the world existed it was possible for the world
 to be, not, indeed, according to a passive power which is matter, but
 according to the active power of God; and also, according as a thing
 is called absolutely possible, not in relation to any power, but from
 the sole habitude of the terms which are not repugnant to each other;
 in which sense possible is opposed to impossible, as appears from the
 Philosopher (Metaph. v, text 17).
"," Whatever has power always to be, from the fact of
 having that power, cannot sometimes be and sometimes not be; but
 before it received that power, it did not exist.
"," Aristotle (Phys. i, text 82) proves that matter is
 unbegotten from the fact that it has not a subject from which to
 derive its existence; and (De Coelo et Mundo i, text 20) he proves
 that heaven is ungenerated, forasmuch as it has no contrary from
 which to be generated. Hence it appears that no conclusion follows
 either way, except that matter and heaven did not begin by
 generation, as some said, especially about heaven. But we say that
 matter and heaven were produced into being by creation, as appears
 above (Q. 44, A. 1, ad 2).
"," The notion of a vacuum is not only ""in which is
 nothing,"" but also implies a space capable of holding a body and in
 which there is not a body, as appears from Aristotle (Phys. iv, text
 60). Whereas we hold that there was no place or space before the
 world was.
"," The first mover was always in the same state: but the
 first movable thing was not always so, because it began to be whereas
 hitherto it was not. This, however, was not through change, but by
 creation, which is not change, as said above (Q. 45, A. 2, ad 2).
 Hence it is evident that this reason, which Aristotle gives (Phys.
 viii), is valid against those who admitted the existence of eternal
 movable things, but not eternal movement, as appears from the
 opinions of Anaxagoras and Empedocles. But we hold that from the
 moment that movable things began to exist movement also existed.
"," The first agent is a voluntary agent. And although He
 had the eternal will to produce some effect, yet He did not produce
 an eternal effect. Nor is it necessary for some change to be
 presupposed, not even on account of imaginary time. For we must take
 into consideration the difference between a particular agent, that
 presupposes something and produces something else, and the universal
 agent, who produces the whole. The particular agent produces the
 form, and presupposes the matter; and hence it is necessary that it
 introduce the form in due proportion into a suitable matter. Hence it
 is correct to say that it introduces the form into such matter, and
 not into another, on account of the different kinds of matter. But
 it is not correct to say so of God Who produces form and matter
 together: whereas it is correct to say of Him that He produces
 matter fitting to the form and to the end. Now, a particular agent
 presupposes time just as it presupposes matter. Hence it is correctly
 described as acting in time ""after"" and not in time ""before,""
 according to an imaginary succession of time after time. But the
 universal agent who produces the thing and time also, is not
 correctly described as acting now, and not before, according to an
 imaginary succession of time succeeding time, as if time were
 presupposed to His action; but He must be considered as giving time
 to His effect as much as and when He willed, and according to what
 was fitting to demonstrate His power. For the world leads more
 evidently to the knowledge of the divine creating power, if it was
 not always, than if it had always been; since everything which was
 not always manifestly has a cause; whereas this is not so manifest
 of what always was.
"," As is stated (Phys. iv, text 99), ""before"" and ""after""
 belong to time, according as they are in movement. Hence beginning
 and end in time must be taken in the same way as in movement. Now,
 granted the eternity of movement, it is necessary that any given
 moment in movement be a beginning and an end of movement; which need
 not be if movement be a beginning. The same applies to the ""now"" of
 time. Thus it appears that the idea of the instant ""now,"" as being
 always the beginning and end of time, presupposes the eternity of
 time and movement. Hence Aristotle brings forward this reason (Phys.
 viii, text 10) against those who asserted the eternity of time, but
 denied the eternity of movement.
"," God is prior to the world by priority of duration. But
 the word ""prior"" signifies priority not of time, but of eternity. Or
 we may say that it signifies the eternity of imaginary time, and not
 of time really existing; thus, when we say that above heaven there is
 nothing, the word ""above"" signifies only an imaginary place,
 according as it is possible to imagine other dimensions beyond those
 of the heavenly body.
"," As the effect follows from the cause that acts by
 nature, according to the mode of its form, so likewise it follows
 from the voluntary agent, according to the form preconceived and
 determined by the agent, as appears from what was said above (Q. 19,
 A. 4; Q. 41, A. 2). Therefore, although God was from eternity the
 sufficient cause of the world, we should not say that the world was
 produced by Him, except as preordained by His will--that is, that it
 should have being after not being, in order more manifestly to
 declare its author.
"," Given the action, the effect follows according to the
 requirement of the form, which is the principle of action. But in
 agents acting by will, what is conceived and preordained is to be
 taken as the form, which is the principle of action. Therefore from
 the eternal action of God an eternal effect did not follow; but such
 an effect as God willed, an effect, to wit, which has being after not
 being.
",,,,,,
246,"[I, Q. 46, Art. 2]
","Whether It Is an Article of Faith That the World Began?
"," It would seem that it is not an article of faith but a
 demonstrable conclusion that the world began. For everything that
 is made has a beginning of its duration. But it can be proved
 demonstratively that God is the effective cause of the world; indeed
 this is asserted by the more approved philosophers. Therefore it can
 be demonstratively proved that the world began.
"," Further, if it is necessary to say that the world was made by
 God, it must therefore have been made from nothing or from something.
 But it was not made from something; otherwise the matter of the world
 would have preceded the world; against which are the arguments of
 Aristotle (De Coelo i), who held that heaven was ungenerated.
 Therefore it must be said that the world was made from nothing; and
 thus it has being after not being. Therefore it must have begun.
"," Further, everything which works by intellect works from some
 principle, as appears in all kinds of craftsmen. But God acts by
 intellect: therefore His work has a principle. The world, therefore,
 which is His effect, did not always exist.
"," Further, it appears manifestly that certain arts have
 developed, and certain countries have begun to be inhabited at some
 fixed time. But this would not be the case if the world had been
 always. Therefore it is manifest that the world did not always exist.
"," Further, it is certain that nothing can be equal to God. But
 if the world had always been, it would be equal to God in duration.
 Therefore it is certain that the world did not always exist.
"," Further, if the world always was, the consequence is that
 infinite days preceded this present day. But it is impossible to pass
 through an infinite medium. Therefore we should never have arrived at
 this present day; which is manifestly false.
"," Further, if the world was eternal, generation also was
 eternal. Therefore one man was begotten of another in an infinite
 series. But the father is the efficient cause of the son (Phys. ii,
 text 5). Therefore in efficient causes there could be an infinite
 series, which is disproved (Metaph. ii, text 5).
"," Further, if the world and generation always were, there have
 been an infinite number of men. But man's soul is immortal: therefore
 an infinite number of human souls would actually now exist, which is
 impossible. Therefore it can be known with certainty that the world
 began, and not only is it known by faith.
",,,,,,,,,," As Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xi, 4), the opinion of
 philosophers who asserted the eternity of the world was twofold. For
 some said that the substance of the world was not from God, which is
 an intolerable error; and therefore it is refuted by proofs that are
 cogent. Some, however, said that the world was eternal, although made
 by God. For they hold that the world has a beginning, not of time,
 but of creation, so that in a certain hardly intelligible way it was
 always made. ""And they try to explain their meaning thus (De Civ. Dei
 x, 31): for as, if the foot were always in the dust from eternity,
 there would always be a footprint which without doubt was caused by
 him who trod on it, so also the world always was, because its Maker
 always existed."" To understand this we must consider that the
 efficient cause, which acts by motion, of necessity precedes its
 effect in time; because the effect is only in the end of the action,
 and every agent must be the principle of action. But if the action is
 instantaneous and not successive, it is not necessary for the maker
 to be prior to the thing made in duration as appears in the case of
 illumination. Hence they say that it does not follow necessarily if
 God is the active cause of the world, that He should be prior to the
 world in duration; because creation, by which He produced the world,
 is not a successive change, as was said above (Q. 45, A. 2).
"," Those who would say that the world was eternal, would
 say that the world was made by God from nothing, not that it was made
 after nothing, according to what we understand by the word creation,
 but that it was not made from anything; and so also some of them do
 not reject the word creation, as appears from Avicenna (Metaph. ix,
 text 4).
"," This is the argument of Anaxagoras (as quoted in Phys.
 viii, text 15). But it does not lead to a necessary conclusion,
 except as to that intellect which deliberates in order to find out
 what should be done, which is like movement. Such is the human
 intellect, but not the divine intellect (Q. 14, AA. 7, 12).
"," Those who hold the eternity of the world hold that
 some region was changed an infinite number of times, from being
 uninhabitable to being inhabitable and ""vice versa,"" and likewise
 they hold that the arts, by reason of various corruptions and
 accidents, were subject to an infinite variety of advance and decay.
 Hence Aristotle says (Meteor. i), that it is absurd from such
 particular changes to hold the opinion of the newness of the whole
 world.
"," Even supposing that the world always was, it would not
 be equal to God in eternity, as Boethius says (De Consol. v, 6);
 because the divine Being is all being simultaneously without
 succession; but with the world it is otherwise.
"," Passage is always understood as being from term to
 term. Whatever bygone day we choose, from it to the present day there
 is a finite number of days which can be passed through. The objection
 is founded on the idea that, given two extremes, there is an infinite
 number of mean terms.
"," In efficient causes it is impossible to proceed to
 infinity per se--thus, there cannot be an infinite number of causes
 that are per se required for a certain effect; for instance, that a
 stone be moved by a stick, the stick by the hand, and so on to
 infinity. But it is not impossible to proceed to infinity
 accidentally as regards efficient causes; for instance, if all the
 causes thus infinitely multiplied should have the order of only one
 cause, their multiplication being accidental, as an artificer acts by
 means of many hammers accidentally, because one after the other may
 be broken. It is accidental, therefore, that one particular hammer
 acts after the action of another; and likewise it is accidental to
 this particular man as generator to be generated by another man; for
 he generates as a man, and not as the son of another man. For all men
 generating hold one grade in efficient causes--viz. the grade of a
 particular generator. Hence it is not impossible for a man to be
 generated by man to infinity; but such a thing would be impossible
 if the generation of this man depended upon this man, and on an
 elementary body, and on the sun, and so on to infinity.
"," Those who hold the eternity of the world evade this
 reason in many ways. For some do not think it impossible for there to
 be an actual infinity of souls, as appears from the Metaphysics of
 Algazel, who says that such a thing is an accidental infinity. But
 this was disproved above (Q. 7, A. 4). Some say that the soul is
 corrupted with the body. And some say that of all souls only one will
 remain. But others, as Augustine says [*Serm. xiv, De Temp. 4, 5; De
 Haeres., haeres. 46; De Civ. Dei xii. 13], asserted on this account a
 circuit of souls--viz. that souls separated from their bodies return
 again thither after a course of time; a fuller consideration of which
 matters will be given later (Q. 75, A. 2; Q. 118, A. 6). But be it
 noted that this argument considers only a particular case. Hence one
 might say that the world was eternal, or at least some creature, as
 an angel, but not man. But we are considering the question in
 general, as to whether any creature can exist from eternity.
",,,,,,,,
247,"[I, Q. 46, Art. 3]
","Whether the Creation of Things Was in the Beginning of Time?
"," It would seem that the creation of things was not in the
 beginning of time. For whatever is not in time, is not of any part of
 time. But the creation of things was not in time; for by the creation
 the substance of things was brought into being; and time does not
 measure the substance of things, and especially of incorporeal things.
 Therefore creation was not in the beginning of time.
"," Further, the Philosopher proves (Phys. vi, text 40) that
 everything which is made, was being made; and so to be made implies
 a ""before"" and ""after."" But in the beginning of time, since it is
 indivisible, there is no ""before"" and ""after."" Therefore, since to be
 created is a kind of ""being made,"" it appears that things were not
 created in the beginning of time.
"," Further, even time itself is created. But time cannot be
 created in the beginning of time, since time is divisible, and the
 beginning of time is indivisible. Therefore, the creation of things
 was not in the beginning of time.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Things are said to be created in the beginning of time,
 not as if the beginning of time were a measure of creation, but
 because together with time heaven and earth were created.
"," This saying of the Philosopher is understood ""of being
 made"" by means of movement, or as the term of movement. Because,
 since in every movement there is ""before"" and ""after,"" before any one
 point in a given movement--that is, whilst anything is in the process
 of being moved and made, there is a ""before"" and also an ""after,""
 because what is in the beginning of movement or in its term is not
 in ""being moved."" But creation is neither movement nor the term of
 movement, as was said above (Q. 45, AA. 2, 3). Hence a thing is
 created in such a way that it was not being created before.
"," Nothing is made except as it exists. But nothing exists
 of time except ""now."" Hence time cannot be made except according to
 some ""now""; not because in the first ""now"" is time, but because from
 it time begins.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
248,"[I, Q. 47, Art. 1]
","Whether the Multitude and Distinction of Things Come from God?
"," It would seem that the multitude and distinction of
 things does not come from God. For one naturally always makes one.
 But God is supremely one, as appears from what precedes (Q. 11, A.
 4). Therefore He produces but one effect.
"," Further, the representation is assimilated to its exemplar.
 But God is the exemplar cause of His effect, as was said above (Q.
 44, A. 3). Therefore, as God is one, His effect is one only, and not
 diverse.
"," Further, the means are proportional to the end. But the end
 of the creation is one--viz. the divine goodness, as was shown above
 (Q. 44, A. 4). Therefore the effect of God is but one.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The natural agent acts by the form which makes
 it what it is, and which is only one in one thing; and therefore its
 effect is one only. But the voluntary agent, such as God is, as was
 shown above (Q. 19, A. 4), acts by an intellectual form. Since,
 therefore, it is not against God's unity and simplicity to understand
 many things, as was shown above (Q. 15, A. 2), it follows that,
 although He is one, He can make many things.
"," This reason would apply to the representation
 which reflects the exemplar perfectly, and which is multiplied by
 reason of matter only; hence the uncreated image, which is perfect, is
 only one. But no creature represents the first exemplar perfectly,
 which is the divine essence; and, therefore, it can be represented by
 many things. Still, according as ideas are called exemplars, the
 plurality of ideas corresponds in the divine mind to the plurality of
 things.
"," In speculative things the medium of
 demonstration, which demonstrates the conclusion perfectly, is one
 only; whereas probable means of proof are many. Likewise when
 operation is concerned, if the means be equal, so to speak, to the
 end, one only is sufficient. But the creature is not such a means to
 its end, which is God; and hence the multiplication of creatures is
 necessary.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
249,"[I, Q. 47, Art. 2]
","Whether the Inequality of Things Is from God?
"," It would seem that the inequality of things is not from
 God. For it belongs to the best to produce the best. But among things
 that are best, one is not greater than another. Therefore, it belongs
 to God, Who is the Best, to make all things equal.
"," Further, equality is the effect of unity (Metaph. v, text
 20). But God is one. Therefore, He has made all things equal.
"," Further, it is the part of justice to give unequal to unequal
 things. But God is just in all His works. Since, therefore, no
 inequality of things is presupposed to the operation whereby He gives
 being to things, it seems that He has made all things equal.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," It is part of the best agent to produce an effect which
 is best in its entirety; but this does not mean that He makes every
 part of the whole the best absolutely, but in proportion to the
 whole; in the case of an animal, for instance, its goodness would be
 taken away if every part of it had the dignity of an eye. Thus,
 therefore, God also made the universe to be best as a whole,
 according to the mode of a creature; whereas He did not make each
 single creature best, but one better than another. And therefore we
 find it said of each creature, ""God saw the light that it was good""
 (Gen. 1:4); and in like manner of each one of the rest. But of all
 together it is said, ""God saw all the things that He had made, and
 they were very good"" (Gen. 1:31).
"," The first effect of unity is equality; and then comes
 multiplicity; and therefore from the Father, to Whom, according to
 Augustine (De Doctr. Christ. i, 5), is appropriated unity, the Son
 proceeds to Whom is appropriated equality, and then from Him the
 creature proceeds, to which belongs inequality; but nevertheless
 even creatures share in a certain equality--namely, of proportion.
"," This is the argument that persuaded Origen: but it
 holds only as regards the distribution of rewards, the inequality of
 which is due to unequal merits. But in the constitution of things
 there is no inequality of parts through any preceding inequality,
 either of merits or of the disposition of the matter; but inequality
 comes from the perfection of the whole. This appears also in works
 done by art; for the roof of a house differs from the foundation, not
 because it is made of other material; but in order that the house may
 be made perfect of different parts, the artificer seeks different
 material; indeed, he would make such material if he could.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
250,"[I, Q. 47, Art. 3]
","Whether There Is Only One World?
"," It would seem that there is not only one world, but many.
 Because, as Augustine says (QQ. 83, qu. 46), it is unfitting to say
 that God has created things without a reason. But for the same reason
 He created one, He could create many, since His power is not limited
 to the creation of one world; but rather it is infinite, as was shown
 above (Q. 25, A. 2). Therefore God has produced many worlds.
"," Further, nature does what is best and much more does God.
 But it is better for there to be many worlds than one, because many
 good things are better than a few. Therefore many worlds have been
 made by God.
"," Further, everything which has a form in matter can be
 multiplied in number, the species remaining the same, because
 multiplication in number comes from matter. But the world has a form
 in matter. Thus as when I say ""man"" I mean the form, and when I say
 ""this man,"" I mean the form in matter; so when we say ""world,"" the
 form is signified, and when we say ""this world,"" the form in the
 matter is signified. Therefore there is nothing to prevent the
 existence of many worlds.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," This reason proves that the world is one because all
 things must be arranged in one order, and to one end. Therefore from
 the unity of order in things Aristotle infers (Metaph. xii, text 52)
 the unity of God governing all; and Plato (Tim.), from the unity of
 the exemplar, proves the unity of the world, as the thing designed.
"," No agent intends material plurality as the end
 forasmuch as material multitude has no certain limit, but of itself
 tends to infinity, and the infinite is opposed to the notion of end.
 Now when it is said that many worlds are better than one, this has
 reference to material order. But the best in this sense is not the
 intention of the divine agent; forasmuch as for the same reason it
 might be said that if He had made two worlds, it would be better if
 He had made three; and so on to infinite.
"," The world is composed of the whole of its matter. For
 it is not possible for there to be another earth than this one, since
 every earth would naturally be carried to this central one, wherever
 it was. The same applies to the other bodies which are part of the
 world.

251,"[I, Q. 48, Art. 1]
","Whether Evil Is a Nature?
"," It would seem that evil is a nature. For every genus is
 a nature. But evil is a genus; for the Philosopher says (Praedic. x)
 that ""good and evil are not in a genus, but are genera of other
 things."" Therefore evil is a nature.
"," Further, every difference which constitutes a species is a
 nature. But evil is a difference constituting a species of morality;
 for a bad habit differs in species from a good habit, as liberality
 from illiberality. Therefore evil signifies a nature.
"," Further, each extreme of two contraries is a nature. But evil
 and good are not opposed as privation and habit, but as contraries,
 as the Philosopher shows (Praedic. x) by the fact that between good
 and evil there is a medium, and from evil there can be a return to
 good. Therefore evil signifies a nature.
"," Further, what is not, acts not. But evil acts, for it
 corrupts good. Therefore evil is a being and a nature.
"," Further, nothing belongs to the perfection of the universe
 except what is a being and a nature. But evil belongs to the
 perfection of the universe of things; for Augustine says (Enchir.
 10, 11) that the ""admirable beauty of the universe is made up of all
 things. In which even what is called evil, well ordered and in its
 place, is the eminent commendation of what is good."" Therefore evil
 is a nature.
",,,,,,,,,,,,," Aristotle speaks there according to the opinion of
 Pythagoreans, who thought that evil was a kind of nature; and
 therefore they asserted the existence of the genus of good and evil.
 For Aristotle, especially in his logical works, brings forward
 examples that in his time were probable in the opinion of some
 philosophers. Or, it may be said that, as the Philosopher says
 (Metaph. iv, text 6), ""the first kind of contrariety is habit and
 privation,"" as being verified in all contraries; since one contrary
 is always imperfect in relation to another, as black in relation to
 white, and bitter in relation to sweet. And in this way good and evil
 are said to be genera not simply, but in regard to contraries;
 because, as every form has the nature of good, so every privation, as
 such, has the nature of evil.
"," Good and evil are not constitutive differences except
 in morals, which receive their species from the end, which is the
 object of the will, the source of all morality. And because good has
 the nature of an end, therefore good and evil are specific
 differences in moral things; good in itself, but evil as the absence
 of the due end. Yet neither does the absence of the due end by itself
 constitute a moral species, except as it is joined to the undue end;
 just as we do not find the privation of the substantial form in
 natural things, unless it is joined to another form. Thus, therefore,
 the evil which is a constitutive difference in morals is a certain
 good joined to the privation of another good; as the end proposed by
 the intemperate man is not the privation of the good of reason, but
 the delight of sense without the order of reason. Hence evil is not a
 constitutive difference as such, but by reason of the good that is
 annexed.
"," This appears from the above. For the Philosopher speaks
 there of good and evil in morality. Because in that respect, between
 good and evil there is a medium, as good is considered as something
 rightly ordered, and evil as a thing not only out of right order, but
 also as injurious to another. Hence the Philosopher says (Ethic. iv,
 i) that a ""prodigal man is foolish, but not evil."" And from this evil
 in morality, there may be a return to good, but not from any sort of
 evil, for from blindness there is no return to sight, although
 blindness is an evil.
"," A thing is said to act in a threefold sense. In one
 way, formally, as when we say that whiteness makes white; and in that
 sense evil considered even as a privation is said to corrupt good,
 forasmuch as it is itself a corruption or privation of good. In
 another sense a thing is said to act effectively, as when a painter
 makes a wall white. Thirdly, it is said in the sense of the final
 cause, as the end is said to effect by moving the efficient cause.
 But in these two ways evil does not effect anything of itself, that
 is, as a privation, but by virtue of the good annexed to it. For
 every action comes from some form; and everything which is desired as
 an end, is a perfection. And therefore, as Dionysius says (Div. Nom.
 iv): ""Evil does not act, nor is it desired, except by virtue of some
 good joined to it: while of itself it is nothing definite, and beside
 the scope of our will and intention.""
"," As was said above, the parts of the universe are
 ordered to each other, according as one acts on the other, and
 according as one is the end and exemplar of the other. But, as was
 said above, this can only happen to evil as joined to some good.
 Hence evil neither belongs to the perfection of the universe, nor
 does it come under the order of the same, except accidentally, that
 is, by reason of some good joined to it.
",,,,,,,,,,,
252,"[I, Q. 48, Art. 2]
","Whether Evil Is Found in Things?
"," It would seem that evil is not found in things. For
 whatever is found in things, is either something, or a privation of
 something, that is a ""not-being."" But Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv)
 that ""evil is distant from existence, and even more distant from
 non-existence."" Therefore evil is not at all found in things.
"," Further, ""being"" and ""thing"" are convertible. If therefore
 evil is a being in things, it follows that evil is a thing, which is
 contrary to what has been said (A. 1).
"," Further, ""the white unmixed with black is the most white,"" as
 the Philosopher says (Topic. iii, 4). Therefore also the good unmixed
 with evil is the greater good. But God makes always what is best,
 much more than nature does. Therefore in things made by God there is
 no evil.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Evil is distant both from simple being and from simple
 ""not-being,"" because it is neither a habit nor a pure negation, but a
 privation.
"," As the Philosopher says (Metaph. v, text 14), being is
 twofold. In one way it is considered as signifying the entity of a
 thing, as divisible by the ten ""predicaments""; and in that sense it
 is convertible with thing, and thus no privation is a being, and
 neither therefore is evil a being. In another sense being conveys the
 truth of a proposition which unites together subject and attribute by
 a copula, notified by this word ""is""; and in this sense being is what
 answers to the question, ""Does it exist?"" and thus we speak of
 blindness as being in the eye; or of any other privation. In this way
 even evil can be called a being. Through ignorance of this
 distinction some, considering that things may be evil, or that evil
 is said to be in things, believed that evil was a positive thing in
 itself.
"," God and nature and any other agent make what is best in
 the whole, but not what is best in every single part, except in order
 to the whole, as was said above (Q. 47, A. 2). And the whole itself,
 which is the universe of creatures, is all the better and more
 perfect if some things in it can fail in goodness, and do sometimes
 fail, God not preventing this. This happens, firstly, because ""it
 belongs to Providence not to destroy, but to save nature,"" as
 Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv); but it belongs to nature that what may
 fail should sometimes fail; secondly, because, as Augustine says
 (Enchir. 11), ""God is so powerful that He can even make good out of
 evil."" Hence many good things would be taken away if God permitted no
 evil to exist; for fire would not be generated if air was not
 corrupted, nor would the life of a lion be preserved unless the ass
 were killed. Neither would avenging justice nor the patience of a
 sufferer be praised if there were no injustice.

253,"[I, Q. 48, Art. 3]
","Whether Evil Is in Good As in Its Subject?
"," It would seem that evil is not in good as its subject.
 For good is something that exists. But Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv,
 4) that ""evil does not exist, nor is it in that which exists.""
 Therefore, evil is not in good as its subject.
"," Further, evil is not a being; whereas good is a being. But
 ""non-being"" does not require being as its subject. Therefore, neither
 does evil require good as its subject.
"," Further, one contrary is not the subject of another. But good
 and evil are contraries. Therefore, evil is not in good as in its
 subject.
"," Further, the subject of whiteness is called white. Therefore
 also the subject of evil is evil. If, therefore, evil is in good as
 in its subject, it follows that good is evil, against what is said
 (Isa. 5:20): ""Woe to you who call evil good, and good evil!""
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," Dionysius means that evil is not in existing things as
 a part, or as a natural property of any existing thing.
"," ""Not-being,"" understood negatively, does not require a
 subject; but privation is negation in a subject, as the Philosopher
 says (Metaph. iv, text 4), and such ""not-being"" is an evil.
"," Evil is not in the good opposed to it as in its
 subject, but in some other good, for the subject of blindness is not
 ""sight,"" but ""animal."" Yet, it appears, as Augustine says
 (Enchiridion 13), that the rule of dialectics here fails, where it is
 laid down that contraries cannot exist together. But this is to be
 taken as referring to good and evil in general, but not in reference
 to any particular good and evil. For white and black, sweet and
 bitter, and the like contraries, are only considered as contraries in
 a special sense, because they exist in some determinate genus;
 whereas good enters into every genus. Hence one good can coexist with
 the privation of another good.
"," The prophet invokes woe to those who say that good as
 such is evil. But this does not follow from what is said above, as is
 clear from the explanation given.
",,,,,,,,,,,,
254,"[I, Q. 48, Art. 4]
","Whether Evil Corrupts the Whole Good?
"," It would seem that evil corrupts the whole good. For
 one contrary is wholly corrupted by another. But good and evil are
 contraries. Therefore evil corrupts the whole good.
"," Further, Augustine says (Enchiridion 12) that ""evil hurts
 inasmuch as it takes away good."" But good is all of a piece and
 uniform. Therefore it is wholly taken away by evil.
"," Further, evil, as long as it lasts, hurts, and takes away
 good. But that from which something is always being removed, is at
 some time consumed, unless it is infinite, which cannot be said of
 any created good. Therefore evil wholly consumes good.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The good which is opposed to evil is wholly taken away;
 but other goods are not wholly removed, as said above.
"," The aforesaid aptitude is a medium between subject and
 act. Hence, where it touches act, it is diminished by evil; but where
 it touches the subject, it remains as it was. Therefore, although
 good is like to itself, yet, on account of its relation to different
 things, it is not wholly, but only partially taken away.
"," Some, imagining that the diminution of this kind of
 good is like the diminution of quantity, said that just as the
 continuous is infinitely divisible, if the division be made in an
 ever same proportion (for instance, half of half, or a third of a
 third), so is it in the present case. But this explanation does not
 avail here. For when in a division we keep the same proportion, we
 continue to subtract less and less; for half of half is less than
 half of the whole. But a second sin does not necessarily diminish the
 above mentioned aptitude less than a preceding sin, but perchance
 either equally or more.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
255,"[I, Q. 48, Art. 5]
","Whether Evil Is Adequately Divided into Pain* and Fault?
"," It would seem that evil is not adequately divided into
 pain and fault. For every defect is a kind of evil. But in all
 creatures there is the defect of not being able to preserve their own
 existence, which nevertheless is neither a pain nor a fault. Therefore
 evil is inadequately divided into pain and fault.
"," Further, in irrational creatures there is neither fault nor
 pain; but, nevertheless, they have corruption and defect, which are
 evils. Therefore not every evil is a pain or a fault.
"," Further, temptation is an evil, but it is not a fault; for
 ""temptation which involves no consent, is not a sin, but an occasion
 for the exercise of virtue,"" as is said in a gloss on 2 Cor. 12; not
 is it a pain; because temptation precedes the fault, and the pain
 follows afterwards. Therefore, evil is not sufficiently divided into
 pain and fault.
"," On the contrary, It would seem that this division is
 superfluous: for, as Augustine says (Enchiridion 12), a thing is evil
 ""because it hurts."" But whatever hurts is penal. Therefore every evil
 comes under pain.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," Because evil is the privation of good, and not a mere
 negation, as was said above (A. 3), therefore not every defect of
 good is an evil, but the defect of the good which is naturally due.
 For the want of sight is not an evil in a stone, but it is an evil
 in an animal; since it is against the nature of a stone to see. So,
 likewise, it is against the nature of a creature to be preserved in
 existence by itself, because existence and conservation come from one
 and the same source. Hence this kind of defect is not an evil as
 regards a creature.
"," Pain and fault do not divide evil absolutely
 considered, but evil that is found in voluntary things.
"," Temptation, as importing provocation to evil, is always
 an evil of fault in the tempter; but in the one tempted it is not,
 properly speaking, a fault; unless through the temptation some change
 is wrought in the one who is tempted; for thus is the action of the
 agent in the patient. And if the tempted is changed to evil by the
 tempter he falls into fault.
"," In answer to the opposite argument, it must be said
 that the very nature of pain includes the idea of injury to the agent
 in himself, whereas the idea of fault includes the idea of injury to
 the agent in his operation; and thus both are contained in evil, as
 including the idea of injury.
",,,,,,,,,,,,
256,"[I, Q. 48, Art. 6]
","Whether Pain Has the Nature of Evil More Than Fault Has?
"," It would seem that pain has more of evil than fault. For
 fault is to pain what merit is to reward. But reward has more good
 than merit, as its end. Therefore pain has more evil in it than fault
 has.
"," Further, that is the greater evil which is opposed to the
 greater good. But pain, as was said above (A. 5), is opposed to
 the good of the agent, while fault is opposed to the good of the
 action. Therefore, since the agent is better than the action, it
 seems that pain is worse than fault.
"," Further, the privation of the end is a pain consisting in
 forfeiting the vision of God; whereas the evil of fault is privation
 of the order to the end. Therefore pain is a greater evil than fault.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Although fault results in pain, as merit in reward, yet
 fault is not intended on account of the pain, as merit is for the
 reward; but rather, on the contrary, pain is brought about so that
 the fault may be avoided, and thus fault is worse than pain.
"," The order of action which is destroyed by fault is the
 more perfect good of the agent, since it is the second perfection,
 than the good taken away by pain, which is the first perfection.
"," Pain and fault are not to be compared as end and order
 to the end; because one may be deprived of both of these in some way,
 both by fault and by pain; by pain, accordingly as a man is removed
 from the end and from the order to the end; by fault, inasmuch as
 this privation belongs to the action which is not ordered to its due
 end.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
257,"[I, Q. 49, Art. 1]
","Whether Good Can Be the Cause of Evil?
"," It would seem that good cannot be the cause of evil. For
 it is said (Matt. 7:18): ""A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit.""
"," Further, one contrary cannot be the cause of another. But
 evil is the contrary to good. Therefore good cannot be the cause of
 evil.
"," Further, a deficient effect can proceed only from a deficient
 cause. But evil is a deficient effect. Therefore its cause, if it has
 one, is deficient. But everything deficient is an evil. Therefore the
 cause of evil can only be evil.
"," Further, Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv) that evil has no
 cause. Therefore good is not the cause of evil.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," As Augustine says (Contra Julian. i): ""The Lord calls
 an evil will the evil tree, and a good will a good tree."" Now, a good
 will does not produce a morally bad act, since it is from the good
 will itself that a moral act is judged to be good. Nevertheless the
 movement itself of an evil will is caused by the rational creature,
 which is good; and thus good is the cause of evil.
"," Good does not cause that evil which is contrary to
 itself, but some other evil: thus the goodness of the fire causes
 evil to the water, and man, good as to his nature, causes an act
 morally evil. And, as explained above (Q. 19, A. 9), this is by
 accident. Moreover, it does happen sometimes that one contrary causes
 another by accident: for instance, the exterior surrounding cold
 heats (the body) through the concentration of the inward heat.
"," Evil has a deficient cause in voluntary things
 otherwise than in natural things. For the natural agent produces the
 same kind of effect as it is itself, unless it is impeded by some
 exterior thing; and this amounts to some defect belonging to it.
 Hence evil never follows in the effect, unless some other evil
 pre-exists in the agent or in the matter, as was said above. But in
 voluntary things the defect of the action comes from the will
 actually deficient, inasmuch as it does not actually subject itself
 to its proper rule. This defect, however, is not a fault, but fault
 follows upon it from the fact that the will acts with this defect.
"," Evil has no direct cause, but only an accidental cause,
 as was said above.
",,,,,,,,,,,,
258,"[I, Q. 49, Art. 2]
","Whether the Supreme Good, God, Is the Cause of Evil?
"," It would seem that the supreme good, God, is the cause of
 evil. For it is said (Isa. 45:5,7): ""I am the Lord, and there is no
 other God, forming the light, and creating darkness, making peace, and
 creating evil."" And Amos 3:6, ""Shall there be evil in a city, which
 the Lord hath not done?""
"," Further, the effect of the secondary cause is reduced to the
 first cause. But good is the cause of evil, as was said above (A. 1).
 Therefore, since God is the cause of every good, as was shown above
 (Q. 2, A. 3; Q. 6, AA. 1, 4), it follows that also every evil is from
 God.
"," Further, as is said by the Philosopher (Phys. ii, text 30),
 the cause of both safety and danger of the ship is the same. But God
 is the cause of the safety of all things. Therefore He is the cause
 of all perdition and of all evil.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," These passages refer to the evil of penalty, and not to
 the evil of fault.
"," The effect of the deficient secondary cause is reduced
 to the first non-deficient cause as regards what it has of being and
 perfection, but not as regards what it has of defect; just as
 whatever there is of motion in the act of limping is caused by the
 motive power, whereas what there is of obliqueness in it does not
 come from the motive power, but from the curvature of the leg. And,
 likewise, whatever there is of being and action in a bad action, is
 reduced to God as the cause; whereas whatever defect is in it is not
 caused by God, but by the deficient secondary cause.
"," The sinking of a ship is attributed to the sailor as
 the cause, from the fact that he does not fulfil what the safety of
 the ship requires; but God does not fail in doing what is necessary
 for the safety of all. Hence there is no parity.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
259,"[I, Q. 49, Art. 3]
","Whether There Be One Supreme Evil Which Is the Cause of Every Evil?
"," It would seem that there is one supreme evil which is
 the cause of every evil. For contrary effects have contrary causes.
 But contrariety is found in things, according to Ecclus. 33:15: ""Good
 is set against evil, and life against death; so also is the sinner
 against a just man."" Therefore there are many contrary principles,
 one of good, the other of evil.
"," Further, if one contrary is in nature, so is the other. But
 the supreme good is in nature, and is the cause of every good, as was
 shown above (Q. 2, A. 3; Q. 6, AA. 2, 4). Therefore, also, there is a
 supreme evil opposed to it as the cause of every evil.
"," Further, as we find good and better things, so we find evil
 and worse. But good and better are so considered in relation to what
 is best. Therefore evil and worse are so considered in relation to
 some supreme evil.
"," Further, everything participated is reduced to what is
 essential. But things which are evil among us are evil not
 essentially, but by participation. Therefore we must seek for
 some supreme essential evil, which is the cause of every evil.
"," Further, whatever is accidental is reduced to that which is
 per se. But good is the accidental cause of evil. Therefore, we
 must suppose some supreme evil which is the per se cause of evils.
 Nor can it be said that evil has no per se cause, but only an
 accidental cause; for it would then follow that evil would not exist
 in the many, but only in the few.
"," Further, the evil of the effect is reduced to the evil of the
 cause; because the deficient effect comes from the deficient cause,
 as was said above (AA. 1, 2). But we cannot proceed to infinity in
 this matter. Therefore, we must suppose one first evil as the cause
 of every evil.
",,,,,,,,,,,," Contraries agree in one genus, and they also agree
 in the nature of being; and therefore, although they have contrary
 particular causes, nevertheless we must come at last to one first
 common cause.
"," Privation and habit belong naturally to the same
 subject. Now the subject of privation is a being in potentiality, as
 was said above (Q. 48, A. 3). Hence, since evil is privation of good,
 as appears from what was said above (Q. 48, AA. 1, 2, 3), it is
 opposed to that good which has some potentiality, but not to the
 supreme good, who is pure act.
"," Increase in intensity is in proportion to the nature
 of  a thing. And as the form is a perfection, so privation removes a
 perfection. Hence every form, perfection, and good is intensified by
 approach to the perfect term; but privation and evil by receding from
 that term. Hence a thing is not said to be evil and worse, by reason
 of access to the supreme evil, in the same way as it is said to be
 good and better, by reason of access to the supreme good.
"," No being is called evil by participation, but by
 privation of participation. Hence it is not necessary to reduce it
 to any essential evil.
"," Evil can only have an accidental cause, as was shown
 above (A. 1). Hence reduction to any 'per se' cause of evil is
 impossible. And to say that evil is in the greater number is simply
 false. For things which are generated and corrupted, in which alone
 can there be natural evil, are the smaller part of the whole
 universe. And again, in every species the defect of nature is in the
 smaller number. In man alone does evil appear as in the greater
 number; because the good of man as regards the senses is not the good
 of man as man--that is, in regard to reason; and more men seek good
 in regard to the senses than good according to reason.
"," In the causes of evil we do not proceed to infinity,
 but reduce all evils to some good cause, whence evil follows
 accidentally.

260,"[I, Q. 50, Art. 1]
","Whether an Angel Is Altogether Incorporeal?
"," It would seem that an angel is not entirely incorporeal.
 For what is incorporeal only as regards ourselves, and not in relation
 to God, is not absolutely incorporeal. But Damascene says (De Fide
 Orth. ii) that ""an angel is said to be incorporeal and immaterial as
 regards us; but compared to God it is corporeal and material.
 Therefore he is not simply incorporeal.""
"," Further, nothing is moved except a body, as the Philosopher
 says (Phys. vi, text 32). But Damascene says (De Fide Orth. ii) that
 ""an angel is an ever movable intellectual substance."" Therefore an
 angel is a corporeal substance.
"," Further, Ambrose says (De Spir. Sanct. i, 7): ""Every creature
 is limited within its own nature."" But to be limited belongs to
 bodies. Therefore, every creature is corporeal. Now angels are God's
 creatures, as appears from Ps. 148:2: ""Praise ye"" the Lord, ""all His
 angels""; and, farther on (verse 4), ""For He spoke, and they were
 made; He commanded, and they were created."" Therefore angels are
 corporeal.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Incorporeal substances rank between God and corporeal
 creatures. Now the medium compared to one extreme appears to be the
 other extreme, as what is tepid compared to heat seems to be cold;
 and thus it is said that angels, compared to God, are material and
 corporeal, not, however, as if anything corporeal existed in them.
"," Movement is there taken in the sense in which it is
 applied to intelligence and will. Therefore an angel is called an
 ever mobile substance, because he is ever actually intelligent, and
 not as if he were sometimes actually and sometimes potentially, as we
 are. Hence it is clear that the objection rests on an equivocation.
"," To be circumscribed by local limits belongs to bodies
 only; whereas to be circumscribed by essential limits belongs to all
 creatures, both corporeal and spiritual. Hence Ambrose says (De Spir.
 Sanct. i, 7) that ""although some things are not contained in
 corporeal place, still they are none the less circumscribed by their
 substance.""
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
261,"[I, Q. 50, Art. 2]
","Whether an Angel Is Composed of Matter and Form?
"," It would seem that an angel is composed of matter and
 form. For everything which is contained under any genus is composed of
 the genus, and of the difference which added to the genus makes the
 species. But the genus comes from the matter, and the difference from
 the form (Metaph. xiii, text 6). Therefore everything which is in a
 genus is composed of matter and form. But an angel is in the genus of
 substance. Therefore he is composed of matter and form.
"," Further, wherever the properties of matter exist, there is
 matter. Now the properties of matter are to receive and to substand;
 whence Boethius says (De Trin.) that ""a simple form cannot be a
 subject"": and the above properties are found in the angel. Therefore
 an angel is composed of matter and form.
"," Further, form is act. So what is form only is pure act. But
 an angel is not pure act, for this belongs to God alone. Therefore an
 angel is not form only, but has a form in matter.
"," Further, form is properly limited and perfected by matter. So
 the form which is not in matter is an infinite form. But the form of
 an angel is not infinite, for every creature is finite. Therefore the
 form of an angel is in matter.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," It is difference which constitutes the species. Now
 everything is constituted in a species according as it is determined
 to some special grade of being because ""the species of things are
 like numbers,"" which differ by addition and subtraction of unity, as
 the Philosopher says (Metaph. viii, text 10). But in material things
 there is one thing which determines to a special grade, and that is
 the form; and another thing which is determined, and this is the
 matter; and hence from the latter the genus is derived, and from
 the former the ""difference."" Whereas in immaterial things there is
 no separate determinator and thing determined; each thing by its
 own self holds a determinate grade in being; and therefore in them
 genus and ""difference"" are not derived from different things, but
 from one and the same. Nevertheless, this differs in our mode of
 conception; for, inasmuch as our intellect considers it as
 indeterminate, it derives the idea of their genus; and inasmuch
 as it considers it determinately, it derives the idea of their
 ""difference.""
"," This reason is given in the book on the Fount of
 Life, and it would be cogent, supposing that the receptive mode of
 the intellect and of matter were the same. But this is clearly false.
 For matter receives the form, that thereby it may be constituted in
 some species, either of air, or of fire, or of something else. But
 the intellect does not receive the form in the same way; otherwise
 the opinion of Empedocles (De Anima i, 5, text 26) would be true, to
 the effect that we know earth by earth, and fire by fire. But the
 intelligible form is in the intellect according to the very nature of
 a form; for as such is it so known by the intellect. Hence such a way
 of receiving is not that of matter, but of an immaterial substance.
"," Although there is no composition of matter and form in
 an angel, yet there is act and potentiality. And this can be made
 evident if we consider the nature of material things which contain a
 twofold composition. The first is that of form and matter, whereby
 the nature is constituted. Such a composite nature is not its own
 existence but existence is its act. Hence the nature itself is
 related to its own existence as potentiality to act. Therefore if
 there be no matter, and supposing that the form itself subsists
 without matter, there nevertheless still remains the relation of the
 form to its very existence, as of potentiality to act. And such a
 kind of composition is understood to be in the angels; and this is
 what some say, that an angel is composed of, ""whereby he is,"" and
 ""what is,"" or ""existence,"" and ""what is,"" as Boethius says. For
 ""what is,"" is the form itself subsisting; and the existence itself is
 whereby the substance is; as the running is whereby the runner runs.
 But in God ""existence"" and ""what is"" are not different as was
 explained above (Q. 3, A. 4). Hence God alone is pure act.
"," Every creature is simply finite, inasmuch as its
 existence is not absolutely subsisting, but is limited to some nature
 to which it belongs. But there is nothing against a creature being
 considered relatively infinite. Material creatures are infinite on
 the part of matter, but finite in their form, which is limited by the
 matter which receives it. But immaterial created substances are
 finite in their being; whereas they are infinite in the sense that
 their forms are not received in anything else; as if we were to say,
 for example, that whiteness existing separate is infinite as regards
 the nature of whiteness, forasmuch as it is not contracted to any one
 subject; while its ""being"" is finite as determined to some one
 special nature.

262,"[I, Q. 50, Art. 3]
","Whether the Angels Exist in Any Great Number?
"," It would seem that the angels are not in great numbers.
 For number is a species of quantity, and follows the division of a
 continuous body. But this cannot be in the angels, since they are
 incorporeal, as was shown above (A. 1). Therefore the angels
 cannot exist in any great number.
"," Further, the more a thing approaches to unity, so much the
 less is it multiplied, as is evident in numbers. But among other
 created natures the angelic nature approaches nearest to God.
 Therefore since God is supremely one, it seems that there is the
 least possible number in the angelic nature.
"," Further, the proper effect of the separate substances seems
 to be the movements of the heavenly bodies. But the movements of the
 heavenly bodies fall within some small determined number, which we
 can apprehend. Therefore the angels are not in greater number than
 the movements of the heavenly bodies.
"," Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv) that ""all intelligible and
 intellectual substances subsist because of the rays of the divine
 goodness."" But a ray is only multiplied according to the different
 things that receive it. Now it cannot be said that their matter is
 receptive of an intelligible ray, since intellectual substances are
 immaterial, as was shown above (A. 2). Therefore it seems that the
 multiplication of intellectual substances can only be according to
 the requirements of the first bodies--that is, of the heavenly ones,
 so that in some way the shedding form of the aforesaid rays may be
 terminated in them; and hence the same conclusion is to be drawn as
 before.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," In the angels number is not that of discrete
 quantity, brought about by division of what is continuous, but that
 which is caused by distinction of forms; according as multitude is
 reckoned among the transcendentals, as was said above (Q. 30, A. 3; Q. 11).
"," From the angelic nature being the nighest unto
 God, it must needs have least of multitude in its composition, but not
 so as to be found in few subjects.
"," This is Aristotle's argument (Metaph. xii, text
 44), and it would conclude necessarily if the separate substances were
 made for corporeal substances. For thus the immaterial substances
 would exist to no purpose, unless some movement from them were to
 appear in corporeal things. But it is not true that the immaterial
 substances exist on account of the corporeal, because the end is
 nobler than the means to the end. Hence Aristotle says (Metaph. xii,
 text 44) that this is not a necessary argument, but a probable one. He
 was forced to make use of this argument, since only through sensible
 things can we come to know intelligible ones.
"," This argument comes from the opinion of such as
 hold that matter is the cause of the distinction of things; but this
 was refuted above (Q. 47, A. 1). Accordingly, the multiplication
 of the angels is not to be taken according to matter, nor according to
 bodies, but according to the divine wisdom devising the various orders
 of immaterial substances.

","Whether the Angels Differ in Species?
"," It would seem that the angels do not differ in species.
 For since the ""difference"" is nobler than the 'genus,' all things
 which agree in what is noblest in them, agree likewise in their
 ultimate constitutive difference; and so they are the same according
 to species. But all angels agree in what is noblest in them--that is
 to say, in intellectuality. Therefore all the angels are of one
 species.
"," Further, more and less do not change a species. But the
 angels seem to differ only from one another according to more and
 less--namely, as one is simpler than another, and of keener
 intellect. Therefore the angels do not differ specifically.
"," Further, soul and angel are contra-distinguished mutually
 from each other. But all souls are of the one species. So therefore
 are the angels.
"," Further, the more perfect a thing is in nature, the more
 ought it to be multiplied. But this would not be so if there were but
 one individual under one species. Therefore there are many angels of
 one species.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," ""Difference"" is nobler than genus, as the determined
 is more noble than the undetermined, and the proper than the common,
 but not as one nature is nobler than another; otherwise it would be
 necessary that all irrational animals be of the same species; or that
 there should be in them some form which is higher than the sensible
 soul. Therefore irrational animals differ in species according to the
 various determined degrees of sensitive nature; and in like manner
 all the angels differ in species according to the diverse degrees of
 intellectual nature.
"," More and less change the species, not according as they
 are caused by the intensity or remissness of one form, but according
 as they are caused by forms of diverse degrees; for instance, if we
 say that fire is more perfect than air: and in this way the angels
 are diversified according to more or less.
"," The good of the species preponderates over the good
 of the individual. Hence it is much better for the species to be
 multiplied in the angels than for individuals to be multiplied in
 the one species.
"," Numerical multiplication, since it can be drawn out
 infinitely, is not intended by the agent, but only specific
 multiplication, as was said above (Q. 47, A. 3). Hence the perfection
 of the angelic nature calls for the multiplying of species, but not
 for the multiplying of individuals in one species.

"," It would seem that the angels are not incorruptible; for
 Damascene, speaking of the angel, says (De Fide Orth. ii, 3) that he
 is ""an intellectual substance, partaking of immortality by favor, and
 not by nature.""
"," Further, Plato says in the Timaeus: ""O gods of gods, whose
 maker and father am I: You are indeed my works, dissoluble by nature,
 yet indissoluble because I so will it."" But gods such as these can
 only be understood to be the angels. Therefore the angels are
 corruptible by their nature
"," Further, according to Gregory (Moral. xvi), ""all things would
 tend towards nothing, unless the hand of the Almighty preserved
 them."" But what can be brought to nothing is corruptible. Therefore,
 since the angels were made by God, it would appear that they are
 corruptible of their own nature.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Damascene is dealing with perfect immortality, which
 includes complete immutability; since ""every change is a kind of
 death,"" as Augustine says (Contra Maxim. iii). The angels obtain
 perfect immutability only by favor, as will appear later (Q. 62).
"," By the expression 'gods' Plato understands the heavenly
 bodies, which he supposed to be made up of elements, and therefore
 dissoluble of their own nature; yet they are for ever preserved in
 existence by the Divine will.
"," As was observed above (Q. 44, A. 1) there is a kind of
 necessary thing which has a cause of its necessity. Hence it is not
 repugnant to a necessary or incorruptible being to depend for its
 existence on another as its cause. Therefore, when it is said that
 all things, even the angels, would lapse into nothing, unless
 preserved by God, it is not to be gathered therefrom that there is
 any principle of corruption in the angels; but that the nature of the
 angels is dependent upon God as its cause. For a thing is said to be
 corruptible not merely because God can reduce it to non-existence, by
 withdrawing His act of preservation; but also because it has some
 principle of corruption within itself, or some contrariety, or at
 least the potentiality of matter.

265,"[I, Q. 51, Art. 1]
","Whether the Angels Have Bodies Naturally United to Them?
"," It would seem that angels have bodies naturally united
 to them. For Origen says (Peri Archon i): ""It is God's attribute
 alone--that is, it belongs to the Father, the Son, and the Holy
 Ghost, as a property of nature, that He is understood to exist
 without any material substance and without any companionship of
 corporeal addition."" Bernard likewise says (Hom. vi. super Cant.):
 ""Let us assign incorporeity to God alone even as we do immortality,
 whose nature alone, neither for its own sake nor on account of
 anything else, needs the help of any corporeal organ. But it is clear
 that every created spirit needs corporeal substance."" Augustine also
 says (Gen. ad lit. iii): ""The demons are called animals of the
 atmosphere because their nature is akin to that of aerial bodies.""
 But the nature of demons and angels is the same. Therefore angels
 have bodies naturally united to them.
"," Further, Gregory (Hom. x in Ev.) calls an angel a rational
 animal. But every animal is composed of body and soul. Therefore
 angels have bodies naturally united to them.
"," Further, life is more perfect in the angels than in souls.
 But the soul not only lives, but gives life to the body. Therefore
 the angels animate bodies which are naturally united to them.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," As was said above (Q. 50, A. 1) it was the opinion of
 some that every being is a body; and consequently some seem to have
 thought that there were no incorporeal substances existing except as
 united to bodies; so much so that some even held that God was the
 soul of the world, as Augustine tells us (De Civ. Dei vii). As this
 is contrary to Catholic Faith, which asserts that God is exalted
 above all things, according to Ps. 8:2: ""Thy magnificence is exalted
 beyond the heavens""; Origen, while refusing to say such a thing of
 God, followed the above opinion of others regarding the other
 substances; being deceived here as he was also in many other points,
 by following the opinions of the ancient philosophers. Bernard's
 expression can be explained, that the created spirit needs some
 bodily instrument, which is not naturally united to it, but assumed
 for some purpose, as will be explained (A. 2). Augustine speaks,
 not as asserting the fact, but merely using the opinion of the
 Platonists, who maintained that there are some aerial animals,
 which they termed demons.
"," Gregory calls the angel a rational animal
 metaphorically, on account of the likeness to the rational nature.
"," To give life effectively is a perfection simply
 speaking; hence it belongs to God, as is said (1 Kings 2:6): ""The
 Lord killeth, and maketh alive."" But to give life formally belongs to
 a substance which is part of some nature, and which has not within
 itself the full nature of the species. Hence an intellectual
 substance which is not united to a body is more perfect than one
 which is united to a body.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
266,"[I, Q. 51, Art. 2]
","Whether Angels Assume Bodies?
"," It would seem that angels do not assume bodies. For there
 is nothing superfluous in the work of an angel, as there is nothing of
 the kind in the work of nature. But it would be superfluous for the
 angels to assume bodies, because an angel has no need for a body,
 since his own power exceeds all bodily power. Therefore an angel does
 not assume a body.
"," Further, every assumption is terminated in some union;
 because to assume implies a taking to oneself [ad se sumere]. But a
 body is not united to an angel as to a form, as stated (A. 1); while
 in so far as it is united to the angel as to a mover, it is not said
 to be assumed, otherwise it would follow that all bodies moved by the
 angels are assumed by them. Therefore the angels do not assume bodies.
"," Further, angels do not assume bodies from the earth or water,
 or they could not suddenly disappear; nor again from fire, otherwise
 they would burn whatever things they touched; nor again from air,
 because air is without shape or color. Therefore the angels do not
 assume bodies.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Angels need an assumed body, not for themselves, but on
 our account; that by conversing familiarly with men they may give
 evidence of that intellectual companionship which men expect to have
 with them in the life to come. Moreover that angels assumed bodies
 under the Old Law was a figurative indication that the Word of God
 would take a human body; because all the apparitions in the Old
 Testament were ordained to that one whereby the Son of God appeared
 in the flesh.
"," The body assumed is united to the angel not as its
 form, nor merely as its mover, but as its mover represented by the
 assumed movable body. For as in the Sacred Scripture the properties
 of intelligible things are set forth by the likenesses of things
 sensible, in the same way by Divine power sensible bodies are so
 fashioned by angels as fittingly to represent the intelligible
 properties of an angel. And this is what we mean by an angel
 assuming a body.
"," Although air as long as it is in a state of rarefaction
 has neither shape nor color, yet when condensed it can both be shaped
 and colored as appears in the clouds. Even so the angels assume
 bodies of air, condensing it by the Divine power in so far as is
 needful for forming the assumed body.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
267,"[I, Q. 51, Art. 3]
","Whether the Angels Exercise Functions of Life in the Bodies Assumed?
"," It would seem that the angels exercise functions of life
 in assumed bodies. For pretence is unbecoming in angels of truth. But
 it would be pretence if the body assumed by them, which seems to live
 and to exercise vital functions, did not possess these functions.
 Therefore the angels exercise functions of life in the assumed body.
"," Further, in the works of the angels there is nothing without
 a purpose. But eyes, nostrils, and the other instruments of the
 senses, would be fashioned without a purpose in the body assumed by
 the angel, if he perceived nothing by their means. Consequently, the
 angel perceives by the assumed body; and this is the most special
 function of life.
"," Further, to move hither and thither is one of the functions
 of life, as the Philosopher says (De Anima ii). But the angels are
 manifestly seen to move in their assumed bodies. For it was said
 (Gen. 18:16) that ""Abraham walked with"" the angels, who had appeared
 to him, ""bringing them on the way""; and when Tobias said to the angel
 (Tob. 5:7, 8): ""Knowest thou the way that leadeth to the city of
 Medes?"" he answered: ""I know it; and I have often walked through all
 the ways thereof."" Therefore the angels often exercise functions of
 life in assumed bodies.
"," Further, speech is the function of a living subject, for it
 is produced by the voice, while the voice itself is a sound conveyed
 from the mouth. But it is evident from many passages of Sacred
 Scripture that angels spoke in assumed bodies. Therefore in their
 assumed bodies they exercise functions of life.
"," Further, eating is a purely animal function. Hence the Lord
 after His Resurrection ate with His disciples in proof of having
 resumed life (Luke 24). Now when angels appeared in their assumed
 bodies they ate, and Abraham offered them food, after having
 previously adored them as God (Gen. 18). Therefore the angels
 exercise functions of life in assumed bodies.
"," Further, to beget offspring is a vital act. But this has
 befallen the angels in their assumed bodies; for it is related:
 ""After the sons of God went in to the daughters of men, and they
 brought forth children, these are the mighty men of old, men of
 renown"" (Gen. 6:4). Consequently the angels exercised vital
 functions in their assumed bodies.
",,,,,,,,,,,," As it is in no wise contrary to truth for intelligible
 things to be set forth in Scripture under sensible figures, since it
 is not said for the purpose of maintaining that intelligible things
 are sensible, but in order that properties of intelligible things may
 be understood according to similitude through sensible figures; so it
 is not contrary to the truth of the holy angels that through their
 assumed bodies they appear to be living men, although they are really
 not. For the bodies are assumed merely for this purpose, that the
 spiritual properties and works of the angels may be manifested by the
 properties of man and of his works. This could not so fittingly be
 done if they were to assume true men; because the properties of such
 men would lead us to men, and not to angels.
"," Sensation is entirely a vital function. Consequently it
 can in no way be said that the angels perceive through the organs of
 their assumed bodies. Yet such bodies are not fashioned in vain; for
 they are not fashioned for the purpose of sensation through them, but
 to this end, that by such bodily organs the spiritual powers of the
 angels may be made manifest; just as by the eye the power of the
 angel's knowledge is pointed out, and other powers by the other
 members, as Dionysius teaches (Coel. Hier.).
"," Movement coming from a united mover is a proper
 function of life; but the bodies assumed by the angels are not thus
 moved, since the angels are not their forms. Yet the angels are moved
 accidentally, when such bodies are moved, since they are in them as
 movers are in the moved; and they are here in such a way as not to be
 elsewhere, which cannot be said of God. Accordingly, although God is
 not moved when the things are moved in which He exists, since He is
 everywhere; yet the angels are moved accidentally according to the
 movement of the bodies assumed. But they are not moved according to
 the movement of the heavenly bodies, even though they be in them as
 the movers in the thing moved, because the heavenly bodies do not
 change place in their entirety; nor for the spirit which moves the
 world is there any fixed locality according to any restricted part of
 the world's substance, which now is in the east, and now in the west,
 but according to a fixed quarter; because ""the moving energy is
 always in the east,"" as stated in Phys. viii, text 84.
"," Properly speaking, the angels do not talk through their
 assumed bodies; yet there is a semblance of speech, in so far as they
 fashion sounds in the air like to human voices.
"," Properly speaking, the angels cannot be said to eat,
 because eating involves the taking of food convertible into the
 substance of the eater.
"," As Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xv): ""Many persons
 affirm that they have had the experience, or have heard from such as
 have experienced it, that the Satyrs and Fauns, whom the common folk
 call incubi, have often presented themselves before women, and have
 sought and procured intercourse with them. Hence it is folly to deny
 it. But God's holy angels could not fall in such fashion before the
 deluge. Hence by the sons of God are to be understood the sons of
 Seth, who were good; while by the daughters of men the Scripture
 designates those who sprang from the race of Cain. Nor is it to be
 wondered at that giants should be born of them; for they were not all
 giants, albeit there were many more before than after the deluge.""
 Still if some are occasionally begotten from demons, it is not from
 the seed of such demons, nor from their assumed bodies, but from the
 seed of men taken for the purpose; as when the demon assumes first
 the form of a woman, and afterwards of a man; just as they take the
 seed of other things for other generating purposes, as Augustine says
 (De Trin. iii), so that the person born is not the child of a demon,
 but of a man.
",,,,,,,,,,
268,"[I, Q. 52, Art. 1]
","Whether an Angel Is in a Place?
"," It would seem that an angel is not in a place. For
 Boethius says (De Hebdom.): ""The common opinion of the learned is
 that things incorporeal are not in a place."" And again, Aristotle
 observes (Phys. iv, text 48,57) that ""it is not everything existing
 which is in a place, but only a movable body."" But an angel is not
 a body, as was shown above (Q. 50). Therefore an angel is not in a
 place.
"," Further, place is a ""quantity having position."" But
 everything which is in a place has some position. Now to have a
 position cannot befit an angel, since his substance is devoid of
 quantity, the proper difference of which is to have a position.
 Therefore an angel is not in a place.
"," Further, to be in a place is to be measured and to be
 contained by such place, as is evident from the Philosopher (Phys.
 iv, text 14,119). But an angel can neither be measured nor contained
 by a place, because the container is more formal than the contained;
 as air with regard to water (Phys. iv, text 35,49). Therefore an
 angel is not in a place.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
269,"[I, Q. 52, Art. 2]
","Whether an Angel Can Be in Several Places at Once?
"," It would seem that an angel can be in several places at
 once. For an angel is not less endowed with power than the soul. But
 the soul is in several places at once, for it is entirely in every
 part of the body, as Augustine says (De Trin. vi). Therefore an angel
 can be in several places at once.
"," Further, an angel is in the body which he assumes; and, since
 the body which he assumes is continuous, it would appear that he is
 in every part thereof. But according to the various parts there are
 various places. Therefore the angel is at one time in various places.
"," Further, Damascene says (De Fide Orth. ii) that ""where the
 angel operates, there he is."" But occasionally he operates in several
 places at one time, as is evident from the angel destroying Sodom
 (Gen. 19:25). Therefore an angel can be in several places at the one
 time.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
270,"[I, Q. 52, Art. 3]
","Whether Several Angels Can Be at the Same Time in the Same Place?
"," It would seem that several angels can be at the same
 time in the same place. For several bodies cannot be at the same time
 in the same place, because they fill the place. But the angels do not
 fill a place, because only a body fills a place, so that it be not
 empty, as appears from the Philosopher (Phys. iv, text 52,58).
 Therefore several angels can be in the one place.
"," Further, there is a greater difference between an angel and a
 body than there is between two angels. But an angel and a body are at
 the one time in the one place: because there is no place which is not
 filled with a sensible body, as we find proved in Phys. iv, text. 58.
 Much more, then, can two angels be in the same place.
"," Further, the soul is in every part of the body, according to
 Augustine (De Trin. vi). But demons, although they do not obsess
 souls, do obsess bodies occasionally; and thus the soul and the demon
 are at the one time in the same place; and consequently for the same
 reason all other spiritual substances.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Several angels are not hindered from being in the same
 place because of their filling the place; but for another reason, as
 has been said.
"," An angel and a body are not in a place in the same way;
 hence the conclusion does not follow.
"," Not even a demon and a soul are compared to a body
 according to the same relation of causality; since the soul is its
 form, while the demon is not. Hence the inference does not follow.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
271,"[I, Q. 53, Art. 1]
","Whether an Angel Can Be Moved Locally?
"," It seems that an angel cannot be moved locally. For, as
 the Philosopher proves (Phys. vi, text 32, 86) ""nothing which is devoid
 of parts is moved""; because, while it is in the term wherefrom, it
 is not moved; nor while it is in the term whereto, for it is then
 already moved; consequently it remains that everything which is moved,
 while it is being moved, is partly in the term wherefrom and partly
 in the term whereto. But an angel is without parts. Therefore an
 angel cannot be moved locally.
"," Further, movement is ""the act of an imperfect being,"" as
 the Philosopher says (Phys. iii, text 14). But a beatified angel is
 not imperfect. Consequently a beatified angel is not moved locally.
"," Further, movement is simply because of want. But the holy
 angels have no want. Therefore the holy angels are not moved locally.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," This argument fails of its purpose for a twofold
 reason. First of all, because Aristotle's demonstration deals with
 what is indivisible according to quantity, to which responds a place
 necessarily indivisible. And this cannot be said of an angel.
"," The movement of that which is in potentiality is the
 act of an imperfect agent. But the movement which is by application
 of energy is the act of one in act: because energy implies actuality.
"," The movement of that which is in potentiality is the
 act of an imperfect but the movement of what is in act is not for any
 need of its own, but for another's need. In this way, because of our
 need, the angel is moved locally, according to Heb. 1:14: ""They are
 all [*Vulg.: 'Are they not all . . . ?'] ministering spirits, sent to
 minister for them who receive the inheritance of salvation.""
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
272,"[I, Q. 53, Art. 2]
","Whether an Angel Passes Through Intermediate Space?
"," It would seem that an angel does not pass through
 intermediate space. For everything that passes through a middle space
 first travels along a place of its own dimensions, before passing
 through a greater. But the place responding to an angel, who is
 indivisible, is confined to a point. Therefore if the angel passes
 through middle space, he must reckon infinite points in his movement:
 which is not possible.
"," Further, an angel is of simpler substance than the soul.
 But our soul by taking thought can pass from one extreme to another
 without going through the middle: for I can think of France and
 afterwards of Syria, without ever thinking of Italy, which stands
 between them. Therefore much more can an angel pass from one
 extreme to another without going through the middle.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The place of an angel is not taken as equal to him
 according to magnitude, but according to contact of power: and so the
 angel's place can be divisible, and is not always a mere point. Yet
 even the intermediate divisible places are infinite, as was said
 above: but they are consumed by the continuity of the movement, as is
 evident from the foregoing.
"," While an angel is moved locally, his essence is applied
 to various places: but the soul's essence is not applied to the
 things thought of, but rather the things thought of are in it. So
 there is no comparison.
"," In continuous movement the actual change is not a part
 of the movement, but its conclusion; hence movement must precede
 change. Accordingly such movement is through the mid-space. But in
 movement which is not continuous, the change is a part, as a unit is
 a part of number: hence the succession of the various places, even
 without the mid-space, constitutes such movement.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
273,"[I, Q. 53, Art. 3]
","Whether the Movement of an Angel Is Instantaneous?
"," It would seem that an angel's movement is instantaneous.
 For the greater the power of the mover, and the less the moved resist
 the mover, the more rapid is the movement. But the power of an angel
 moving himself exceeds beyond all proportion the power which moves a
 body. Now the proportion of velocities is reckoned according to the
 lessening of the time. But between one length of time and any other
 length of time there is proportion. If therefore a body is moved in
 time, an angel is moved in an instant.
"," Further, the angel's movement is simpler than any bodily
 change. But some bodily change is effected in an instant, such as
 illumination; both because the subject is not illuminated
 successively, as it gets hot successively; and because a ray does not
 reach sooner what is near than what is remote. Much more therefore is
 the angel's movement instantaneous.
"," Further, if an angel be moved from place to place in time, it
 is manifest that in the last instant of such time he is in the term
 whereto: but in the whole of the preceding time, he is either in
 the place immediately preceding, which is taken as the term
 wherefrom; or else he is partly in the one, and partly in the
 other, it follows that he is divisible; which is impossible.
 Therefore during the whole of the preceding time he is in the term
 wherefrom. Therefore he rests there: since to be at rest is to be
 in the same place now and previously, as was said (A. 2). Therefore
 it follows that he is not moved except in the last instant of time.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," If the time of the angel's movement be not continuous,
 but a kind of succession of 'nows,' it will have no proportion to the
 time which measures the movement of corporeal things, which is
 continuous; since it is not of the same nature. If, however, it be
 continuous, it is indeed proportionable, not, indeed, because of the
 proportion of the mover and the movable, but on account of the
 proportion of the magnitudes in which the movement exists. Besides,
 the swiftness of the angel's movement is not measured by the quantity
 of his power, but according to the determination of his will.
"," Illumination is the term of a movement; and is an
 alteration, not a local movement, as though the light were understood
 to be moved to what is near, before being moved to what is remote.
 But the angel's movement is local, and, besides, it is not the term
 of movement; hence there is no comparison.
"," This objection is based on continuous time. But the
 same time of an angel's movement can be non-continuous. So an angel
 can be in one place in one instant, and in another place in the next
 instant, without any time intervening. If the time of the angel's
 movement be continuous, he is changed through infinite places
 throughout the whole time which precedes the last 'now'; as was
 already shown (A. 2). Nevertheless he is partly in one of the
 continuous places, and partly in another, not because his substance
 is susceptible of parts, but because his power is applied to a part
 of the first place and to a part of the second, as was said above
 (A. 2).
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
274,"[I, Q. 54, Art. 1]
","Whether an Angel's Act of Understanding Is His Substance?
"," It would seem that the angel's act of understanding is
 his substance. For the angel is both higher and simpler than the
 active intellect of a soul. But the substance of the active intellect
 is its own action; as is evident from Aristotle (De Anima iii) and
 from his Commentator [*Averroes, A.D. 1126-1198]. Therefore much more
 is the angel's substance his action--that is, his act of
 understanding.
"," Further, the Philosopher says (Metaph. xii, text 39) that
 ""the action of the intellect is life."" But ""since in living things to
 live is to be,"" as he says (De Anima ii, text 37), it seems that life
 is essence. Therefore the action of the intellect is the essence of
 an angel who understands.
"," Further, if the extremes be one, then the middle does not
 differ from them; because extreme is farther from extreme than the
 middle is. But in an angel the intellect and the object understood
 are the same, at least in so far as he understands his own essence.
 Therefore the act of understanding, which is between the intellect
 and the thing understood, is one with the substance of the angel who
 understands.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," When the active intellect is said to be its own action,
 such predication is not essential, but concomitant, because, since
 its very nature consists in act, instantly, so far as lies in itself,
 action accompanies it: which cannot be said of the passive intellect,
 for this has no actions until after it has been reduced to act.
"," The relation between ""life"" and ""to live"" is not the
 same as that between ""essence"" and ""to be""; but rather as that
 between ""a race"" and ""to run,"" one of which signifies the act in the
 abstract, and the other in the concrete. Hence it does not follow,
 if ""to live"" is ""to be,"" that ""life"" is ""essence."" Although life is
 sometimes put for the essence, as Augustine says (De Trin. x),
 ""Memory and understanding and will are one essence, one life"": yet it
 is not taken in this sense by the Philosopher, when he says that ""the
 act of the intellect is life.""
"," The action which is transient, passing to some
 extrinsic object, is really a medium between the agent and the
 subject receiving the action. The action which remains within the
 agent, is not really a medium between the agent and the object, but
 only according to the manner of expression; for it really follows the
 union of the object with the agent. For the act of understanding is
 brought about by the union of the object understood with the one who
 understands it, as an effect which differs from both.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
275,"[I, Q. 54, Art. 2]
","Whether in the Angel to Understand Is to Exist?
"," It would seem that in the angel to understand is to
 exist. For in living things to live is to be, as the Philosopher says
 (De Anima ii, text. 37). But to ""understand is in a sense to live""
 (De Anima ii, text. 37). Therefore in the angel to understand is to
 exist.
"," Further, cause bears the same relation to cause, as effect to
 effect. But the form whereby the angel exists is the same as the form
 by which he understands at least himself. Therefore in the angel to
 understand is to exist.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Life is sometimes taken for the existence of the living
 subject: sometimes also for a vital operation, that is, for one
 whereby something is shown to be living. In this way the Philosopher
 says that to understand is, in a sense, to live: for there he
 distinguishes the various grades of living things according to the
 various functions of life.
"," The essence of an angel is the reason of his entire
 existence, but not the reason of his whole act of understanding,
 since he cannot understand everything by his essence. Consequently
 in its own specific nature as such an essence, it is compared to the
 existence of the angel, whereas to his act of understanding it is
 compared as included in the idea of a more universal object, namely,
 truth and being. Thus it is evident, that, although the form is the
 same, yet it is not the principle of existence and of understanding
 according to the same formality. On this account it does not follow
 that in the angel ""to be"" is the same as 'to understand.'
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
276,"[I, Q. 54, Art. 3]
","Whether an Angel's Power of Intelligence Is His Essence?
"," It would seem that in an angel the power or faculty of
 understanding is not different from his essence. For, ""mind"" and
 ""intellect"" express the power of understanding. But in many passages
 of his writings, Dionysius styles angels ""intellects"" and ""minds.""
 Therefore the angel is his own power of intelligence.
"," Further, if the angel's power of intelligence be anything
 besides his essence, then it must needs be an accident; for that which
 is besides the essence of anything, we call it accident. But ""a simple
 form cannot be a subject,"" as Boethius states (De Trin. 1). Thus an
 angel would not be a simple form, which is contrary to what has been
 previously said (Q. 50, A. 2).
"," Further, Augustine (Confess. xii) says, that God made the
 angelic nature ""nigh unto Himself,"" while He made primary matter ""nigh
 unto nothing""; from this it would seem that the angel is of a simpler
 nature than primary matter, as being closer to God. But primary matter
 is its own power. Therefore much more is an angel his own power of
 intelligence.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," An angel is called ""intellect"" and ""mind,"" because all
 his knowledge is intellectual: whereas the knowledge of a soul is
 partly intellectual and partly sensitive.
"," A simple form which is pure act cannot be the subject
 of accident, because subject is compared to accident as potentiality
 is to act. God alone is such a form: and of such is Boethius speaking
 there. But a simple form which is not its own existence, but is
 compared to it as potentiality is to act, can be the subject of
 accident; and especially of such accident as follows the species: for
 such accident belongs to the form--whereas an accident which belongs
 to the individual, and which does not belong to the whole species,
 results from the matter, which is the principle of individuation. And
 such a simple form is an angel.
"," The power of matter is a potentiality in regard to
 substantial being itself, whereas the power of operation regards
 accidental being. Hence there is no comparison.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
277,"[I, Q. 54, Art. 4]
","Whether There Is an Active and a Passive Intellect in an Angel?
"," It would seem that there is both an active and a passive
 intellect in an angel. The Philosopher says (De Anima iii, text. 17)
 that, ""in the soul, just as in every nature, there is something
 whereby it can become all things, and there is something whereby it
 can make all things."" But an angel is a kind of nature. Therefore
 there is an active and a passive intellect in an angel.
"," Further, the proper function of the passive intellect is to
 receive; whereas to enlighten is the proper function of the active
 intellect, as is made clear in De Anima iii, text. 2, 3, 18. But an
 angel receives enlightenment from a higher angel, and enlightens a
 lower one. Therefore there is in him an active and a passive
 intellect.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,," As the words themselves show, the Philosopher
 understands those two things to be in every nature in which there
 chances to be generation or making. Knowledge, however, is not
 generated in the angels, but is present naturally. Hence there is
 no need for admitting an active and a passive intellect in them.
"," It is the function of the active intellect to
 enlighten, not another intellect, but things which are intelligible
 in potentiality, in so far as by abstraction it makes them to be
 actually intelligible. It belongs to the passive intellect to be in
 potentiality with regard to things which are naturally capable of
 being known, and sometimes to apprehend them actually. Hence for one
 angel to enlighten another does not belong to the notion of an active
 intellect: neither does it belong to the passive intellect for the
 angel to be enlightened with regard to supernatural mysteries, to the
 knowledge of which he is sometimes in potentiality. But if anyone
 wishes to call these by the names of active and passive intellect, he
 will then be speaking equivocally; and it is not about names that we
 need trouble.

","Whether There Is Only Intellectual Knowledge in the Angels?
"," It would seem that the knowledge of the angels is not
 exclusively intellectual. For Augustine says (De Civ. Dei viii) that
 in the angels there is ""life which understands and feels."" Therefore
 there is a sensitive faculty in them as well.
"," Further, Isidore says (De Summo Bono) that the angels have
 learnt many things by experience. But experience comes of many
 remembrances, as stated in Metaph. i, 1. Consequently they have
 likewise a power of memory.
"," Further, Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv) that there is a sort
 of ""perverted phantasy"" in the demons. But phantasy belongs to the
 imaginative faculty. Therefore the power of the imagination is in the
 demons; and for the same reason it is in the angels, since they are
 of the same nature.

279,"[I, Q. 55, Art. 1]
","Whether the Angels Know All Things by Their Substance?
"," It would seem that the angels know all things by their
 substance. For Dionysius says (Div. Nom. vii) that ""the angels,
 according to the proper nature of a mind, know the things which are
 happening upon earth."" But the angel's nature is his essence.
 Therefore the angel knows things by his essence.
"," Further, according to the Philosopher (Metaph. xii, text. 51;
 De Anima iii, text. 15), ""in things which are without matter, the
 intellect is the same as the object understood."" But the object
 understood is the same as the one who understands it, as regards that
 whereby it is understood. Therefore in things without matter, such as
 the angels, the medium whereby the object is understood is the very
 substance of the one understanding it.
"," Further, everything which is contained in another is there
 according to the mode of the container. But an angel has an
 intellectual nature. Therefore whatever is in him is there in an
 intelligible mode. But all things are in him: because the lower
 orders of beings are essentially in the higher, while the higher are
 in the lower participatively: and therefore Dionysius says (Div. Nom.
 iv) that God ""enfolds the whole in the whole,"" i.e. all in all.
 Therefore the angel knows all things in his substance.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," When it is said that the angel knows things according
 to his own nature, the words ""according to"" do not determine the
 medium of such knowledge, since the medium is the similitude of the
 thing known; but they denote the knowing power, which belongs to the
 angel of his own nature.
"," As the sense in act is the sensible in act, as stated
 in De Anima ii, text. 53, not so that the sensitive power is the
 sensible object's likeness contained in the sense, but because one
 thing is made from both as from act and potentiality: so likewise the
 intellect in act is said to be the thing understood in act, not that
 the substance of the intellect is itself the similitude by which it
 understands, but because that similitude is its form. Now, it is
 precisely the same thing to say ""in things which are without matter,
 the intellect is the same thing as the object understood,"" as to say
 that ""the intellect in act is the thing understood in act""; for a
 thing is actually understood, precisely because it is immaterial.
"," The things which are beneath the angel, and those which
 are above him, are in a measure in his substance, not indeed
 perfectly, nor according to their own proper formality--because the
 angel's essence, as being finite, is distinguished by its own
 formality from other things--but according to some common formality.
 Yet all things are perfectly and according to their own formality in
 God's essence, as in the first and universal operative power, from
 which proceeds whatever is proper or common to anything. Therefore
 God has a proper knowledge of all things by His own essence: and this
 the angel has not, but only a common knowledge.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
280,"[I, Q. 55, Art. 2]
","Whether the Angels Understand by Species Drawn from Things?
"," It would seem that the angels understand by species drawn
 from things. For everything understood is apprehended by some likeness
 within him who understands it. But the likeness of the thing existing
 in another is there either by way of an exemplar, so that the likeness
 is the cause of the thing; or else by way of an image, so that it is
 caused by such thing. All knowledge, then, of the person understanding
 must either be the cause of the object understood, or else caused by
 it. Now the angel's knowledge is not the cause of existing things;
 that belongs to the Divine knowledge alone. Therefore it is necessary
 for the species, by which the angelic mind understands, to be derived
 from things.
"," Further, the angelic light is stronger than the light of the
 active intellect of the soul. But the light of the active intellect
 abstracts intelligible species from phantasms. Therefore the light of
 the angelic mind can also abstract species from sensible things. So
 there is nothing to hinder us from saying that the angel understands
 through species drawn from things.
"," Further, the species in the intellect are indifferent to
 what is present or distant, except in so far as they are taken from
 sensible objects. Therefore, if the angel does not understand by
 species drawn from things, his knowledge would be indifferent as to
 things present and distant; and so he would be moved locally to no
 purpose.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," There are images of creatures in the angel's mind, not,
 indeed derived from creatures, but from God, Who is the cause of
 creatures, and in Whom the likenesses of creatures first exist. Hence
 Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. ii, 8) that, ""As the type, according to
 which the creature is fashioned, is in the Word of God before the
 creature which is fashioned, so the knowledge of the same type exists
 first in the intellectual creature, and is afterwards the very
 fashioning of the creature.""
"," To go from one extreme to the other it is necessary to
 pass through the middle. Now the nature of a form in the imagination,
 which form is without matter but not without material conditions,
 stands midway between the nature of a form which is in matter, and
 the nature of a form which is in the intellect by abstraction from
 matter and from material conditions. Consequently, however powerful
 the angelic mind might be, it could not reduce material forms to an
 intelligible condition, except it were first to reduce them to the
 nature of imagined forms; which is impossible, since the angel has no
 imagination, as was said above (Q. 54, A. 5). Even granted that he
 could abstract intelligible species from material things, yet he
 would not do so; because he would not need them, for he has
 connatural intelligible species.
"," The angel's knowledge is quite indifferent as to what
 is near or distant. Nevertheless his local movement is not
 purposeless on that account: for he is not moved to a place for the
 purpose of acquiring knowledge, but for the purpose of operation.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
281,"[I, Q. 55, Art. 3]
","Whether the Higher Angels Understand by More Universal Species Than
"," It would seem that the higher angels do not understand
 by more universal species than the lower angels. For the universal,
 seemingly, is what is abstracted from particulars. But angels do not
 understand by species abstracted from things. Therefore it cannot be
 said that the species of the angelic intellect are more or less
 universal.
"," Further, whatever is known in detail is more perfectly known
 than what is known generically; because to know anything generically
 is, in a fashion, midway between potentiality and act. If, therefore,
 the higher angels know by more universal species than the lower, it
 follows that the higher have a more imperfect knowledge than the
 lower; which is not befitting.
"," Further, the same cannot be the proper type of many. But if
 the higher angel knows various things by one universal form, which
 the lower angel knows by several special forms, it follows that the
 higher angel uses one universal form for knowing various things.
 Therefore he will not be able to have a proper knowledge of each;
 which seems unbecoming.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," It is accidental to the universal to be abstracted from
 particulars, in so far as the intellect knowing it derives its
 knowledge from things. But if there be an intellect which does not
 derive its knowledge from things, the universal which it knows will
 not be abstracted from things, but in a measure will be pre-existing
 to them; either according to the order of causality, as the universal
 ideas of things are in the Word of God; or at least in the order of
 nature, as the universal ideas of things are in the angelic mind.
"," To know anything universally can be taken in two
 senses. In one way, on the part of the thing known, namely, that only
 the universal nature of the thing is known. To know a thing thus is
 something less perfect: for he would have but an imperfect knowledge
 of a man who only knew him to be an animal. In another way, on the
 part of the medium of such knowledge. In this way it is more perfect
 to know a thing in the universal; for the intellect, which by one
 universal medium can know each of the things which are properly
 contained in it, is more perfect than one which cannot.
"," The same cannot be the proper and adequate type of
 several things. But if it be eminent, then it can be taken as the
 proper type and likeness of many. Just as in man, there is a
 universal prudence with respect to all the acts of the virtues; which
 can be taken as the proper type and likeness of that prudence which
 in the lion leads to acts of magnanimity, and in the fox to acts of
 wariness; and so on of the rest. The Divine essence, on account of
 Its eminence, is in like fashion taken as the proper type of each
 thing contained therein: hence each one is likened to It according to
 its proper type. The same applies to the universal form which is in
 the mind of the angel, so that, on account of its excellence, many
 things can be known through it with a proper knowledge.

282,"[I, Q. 56, Art 1]
","Whether an Angel Knows Himself?
"," It would seem that an angel does not know himself. For
 Dionysius says that ""the angels do not know their own powers"" (Coel.
 Hier. vi). But, when the substance is known, the power is known.
 Therefore an angel does not know his own essence.
"," Further, an angel is a single substance, otherwise he would
 not act, since acts belong to single subsistences. But nothing single
 is intelligible. Therefore, since the angel possesses only knowledge
 which is intellectual, no angel can know himself.
"," Further, the intellect is moved by the intelligible object:
 because, as stated in De Anima iii, 4 understanding is a kind of
 passion. But nothing is moved by or is passive to itself; as appears
 in corporeal things. Therefore the angel cannot understand himself.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," That is the text of the old translation, which is
 amended in the new one, and runs thus: ""furthermore they,"" that is
 to say the angels, ""knew their own powers"": instead of which the
 old translation read--""and furthermore they do not know their own
 powers."" Although even the letter of the old translation might be
 kept in this respect, that the angels do not know their own power
 perfectly; according as it proceeds from the order of the Divine
 Wisdom, Which to the angels is incomprehensible.
"," We have no knowledge of single corporeal things, not
 because of their particularity, but on account of the matter, which
 is their principle of individuation. Accordingly, if there be any
 single things subsisting without matter, as the angels are, there is
 nothing to prevent them from being actually intelligible.
"," It belongs to the intellect, in so far as it is in
 potentiality, to be moved and to be passive. Hence this does not
 happen in the angelic intellect, especially as regards the fact that
 he understands himself. Besides the action of the intellect is not of
 the same nature as the action found in corporeal things, which passes
 into some other matter.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
283,"[I, Q. 56, Art. 2]
","Whether One Angel Knows Another?
"," It would seem that one angel does not know another. For
 the Philosopher says (De Anima iii, text. 4), that if the human
 intellect were to have in itself any one of the sensible things, then
 such a nature existing within it would prevent it from apprehending
 external things; as likewise, if the pupil of the eye were colored
 with some particular color, it could not see every color. But as the
 human intellect is disposed for understanding corporeal things, so is
 the angelic mind for understanding immaterial things. Therefore, since
 the angelic intellect has within itself some one determinate nature
 from the number of such natures, it would seem that it cannot
 understand other natures.
"," Further, it is stated in De Causis that ""every intelligence
 knows what is above it, in so far as it is caused by it; and what is
 beneath it, in so far as it is its cause."" But one angel is not the
 cause of another. Therefore one angel does not know another.
"," Further, one angel cannot be known to another angel by the
 essence of the one knowing; because all knowledge is effected by way
 of a likeness. But the essence of the angel knowing is not like the
 essence of the angel known, except generically; as is clear from what
 has been said before (Q. 50, A. 4; Q. 55, A. 1, ad 3). Hence, it
 follows that one angel would not have a particular knowledge of
 another, but only a general knowledge. In like manner it cannot be
 said that one angel knows another by the essence of the angel known;
 because that whereby the intellect understands is something within
 the intellect; whereas the Trinity alone can penetrate the mind.
 Again, it cannot be said that one angel knows the other by a species;
 because that species would not differ from the angel understood,
 since each is immaterial. Therefore in no way does it appear that one
 angel can understand another.
"," Further, if one angel did understand another, this would be
 either by an innate species; and so it would follow that, if God were
 now to create another angel, such an angel could not be known by the
 existing angels; or else he would have to be known by a species drawn
 from things; and so it would follow that the higher angels could not
 know the lower, from whom they receive nothing. Therefore in no way
 does it seem that one angel knows another.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," The spiritual natures of the angels are distinguished
 from one another in a certain order, as was already observed (Q. 50,
 A. 4, ad 1, 2). So the nature of an angel does not hinder him from
 knowing the other angelic natures, since both the higher and lower
 bear affinity to his nature, the only difference being according to
 their various degrees of perfection.
"," The nature of cause and effect does not lead one angel
 to know another, except on account of likeness, so far as cause and
 effect are alike. Therefore if likeness without causality be admitted
 in the angels, this will suffice for one to know another.
"," One angel knows another by the species of such angel
 existing in his intellect, which differs from the angel whose image
 it is, not according to material and immaterial nature, but according
 to natural and intentional existence. The angel is himself a
 subsisting form in his natural being; but his species in the
 intellect of another angel is not so, for there it possesses only
 an intelligible existence. As the form of color on the wall has a
 natural existence; but, in the deferent medium, it has only
 intentional existence.
"," God made every creature proportionate to the universe
 which He determined to make. Therefore had God resolved to make more
 angels or more natures of things, He would have impressed more
 intelligible species in the angelic minds; as a builder who, if he
 had intended to build a larger house, would have made larger
 foundations. Hence, for God to add a new creature to the universe,
 means that He would add a new intelligible species to an angel.
",,,,,,,,,,,,
284,"[I, Q. 56, Art. 3]
","Whether an Angel Knows God by His Own Natural Principles?
"," It would seem that the angels cannot know God by their
 natural principles. For Dionysius says (Div. Nom. i) that God ""by His
 incomprehensible might is placed above all heavenly minds."" Afterwards
 he adds that, ""since He is above all substances, He is remote from all
 knowledge.""
"," Further, God is infinitely above the intellect of an angel.
 But what is infinitely beyond cannot be reached. Therefore it appears
 that an angel cannot know God by his natural principles.
"," Further, it is written (1 Cor. 13:12): ""We see now through a
 glass in a dark manner; but then face to face."" From this it appears
 that there is a twofold knowledge of God; the one, whereby He is seen
 in His essence, according to which He is said to be seen face to
 face; the other whereby He is seen in the mirror of creatures. As was
 already shown (Q. 12, A. 4), an angel cannot have the former
 knowledge by his natural principles. Nor does vision through a mirror
 belong to the angels, since they do not derive their knowledge of God
 from sensible things, as Dionysius observes (Div. Nom. vii).
 Therefore the angels cannot know God by their natural powers.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Dionysius is speaking of the knowledge of
 comprehension, as his words expressly state. In this way God is not
 known by any created intellect.
"," Since an angel's intellect and essence are infinitely
 remote from God, it follows that he cannot comprehend Him; nor can he
 see God's essence through his own nature. Yet it does not follow on
 that account that he can have no knowledge of Him at all: because, as
 God is infinitely remote from the angel, so the knowledge which God
 has of Himself is infinitely above the knowledge which an angel has
 of Him.
"," The knowledge which an angel has of God is midway
 between these two kinds of knowledge; nevertheless it approaches more
 to one of them, as was said above.

285,"[I, Q. 57, Art. 1]
","Whether the Angels Know Material Things?
"," It would seem that the angels do not know material
 things. For the object understood is the perfection of him who
 understands it. But material things cannot be the perfections of
 angels, since they are beneath them. Therefore the angels do not
 know material things.
"," Further, intellectual vision is only of such things as exist
 within the soul by their essence, as is said in the gloss [*On 2 Cor.
 12:2, taken from Augustine (Gen. ad lit. xii. 28)]. But the material
 things cannot enter by their essence into man's soul, nor into the
 angel's mind. Therefore they cannot be known by intellectual vision,
 but only by imaginary vision, whereby the images of bodies are
 apprehended, and by sensible vision, which regards bodies in
 themselves. Now there is neither imaginary nor sensible vision in
 the angels, but only intellectual. Therefore the angels cannot know
 material things.
"," Further, material things are not actually intelligible, but
 are knowable by apprehension of sense and of imagination, which does
 not exist in angels. Therefore angels do not know material things.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The thing understood is the perfection of the one who
 understands, by reason of the intelligible species which he has in
 his intellect. And thus the intelligible species which are in the
 intellect of an angel are perfections and acts in regard to that
 intellect.
"," Sense does not apprehend the essences of things, but
 only their outward accidents. In like manner neither does the
 imagination; for it apprehends only the images of bodies. The
 intellect alone apprehends the essences of things. Hence it is said
 (De Anima iii, text. 26) that the object of the intellect is ""what a
 thing is,"" regarding which it does not err; as neither does sense
 regarding its proper sensible object. So therefore the essences of
 material things are in the intellect of man and angels, as the thing
 understood is in him who understands, and not according to their real
 natures. But some things are in an intellect or in the soul according
 to both natures; and in either case there is intellectual vision.
"," If an angel were to draw his knowledge of material
 things from the material things themselves, he would require to make
 them actually intelligible by a process of abstraction. But he does
 not derive his knowledge of them from the material things themselves;
 he has knowledge of material things by actually intelligible species
 of things, which species are connatural to him; just as our intellect
 has, by species which it makes intelligible by abstraction.

","Whether an Angel Knows Singulars?
"," It would seem that angels do not know singulars. For the
 Philosopher says (Poster. i, text. 22): ""The sense has for its object
 singulars, but the intellect, universals."" Now, in the angels there is
 no power of understanding save the intellectual power, as is evident
 from what was said above (Q. 54, A. 5). Consequently they do not
 know singulars.
"," Further, all knowledge comes about by some assimilation of
 the knower to the object known. But it is not possible for any
 assimilation to exist between an angel and a singular object, in so
 far as it is singular; because, as was observed above (Q. 50, A. 2),
 an angel is immaterial, while matter is the principle of singularity.
 Therefore the angel cannot know singulars.
"," Further, if an angel does know singulars, it is either by
 singular or by universal species. It is not by singular species;
 because in this way he would require to have an infinite number of
 species. Nor is it by universal species; since the universal is not
 the sufficient principle for knowing the singular as such, because
 singular things are not known in the universal except potentially.
 Therefore the angel does not know singulars.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The Philosopher is speaking of our intellect, which
 apprehends only by a process of abstraction; and by such abstraction
 from material conditions the thing abstracted becomes a universal.
 Such a manner of understanding is not in keeping with the nature of
 the angels, as was said above (Q. 55, A. 2, A. 3 ad 1), and
 consequently there is no comparison.
"," It is not according to their nature that the angels
 are likened to material things, as one thing resembles another by
 agreement in genus, species, or accident; but as the higher bears
 resemblance to the lower, as the sun does to fire. Even in this way
 there is in God a resemblance of all things, as to both matter and
 form, in so far as there pre-exists in Him as in its cause whatever
 is to be found in things. For the same reason, the species in the
 angel's intellect, which are images drawn from the Divine essence,
 are the images of things not only as to their form, but also as to
 their matter.
"," Angels know singulars by universal forms, which
 nevertheless are the images of things both as to their universal, and
 as to their individuating principles. How many things can be known by
 the same species, has been already stated above (Q. 55, A. 3, ad 3).

287,"[I, Q. 57, Art. 3]
","Whether Angels Know the Future?
"," It would seem that the angels know future events. For
 angels are mightier in knowledge than men. But some men know many
 future events. Therefore much more do the angels.
"," Further, the present and the future are differences of time.
 But the angel's intellect is above time; because, as is said in De
 Causis, ""an intelligence keeps pace with eternity,"" that is,
 aeviternity. Therefore, to the angel's mind, past and future are not
 different, but he knows each indifferently.
"," Further, the angel does not understand by species derived
 from things, but by innate universal species. But universal species
 refer equally to present, past, and future. Therefore it appears
 that the angels know indifferently things past, present, and future.
"," Further, as a thing is spoken of as distant by reason of
 time, so is it by reason of place. But angels know things which are
 distant according to place. Therefore they likewise know things
 distant according to future time.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," Men cannot know future things except in their causes,
 or by God's revelation. The angels know the future in the same way,
 but much more distinctly.
"," Although the angel's intellect is above that time
 according to which corporeal movements are reckoned, yet there is a
 time in his mind according to the succession of intelligible
 concepts; of which Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. viii) that ""God moves
 the spiritual creature according to time."" And thus, since there is
 succession in the angel's intellect, not all things that happen
 through all time, are present to the angelic mind.
"," Although the species in the intellect of an angel, in
 so far as they are species, refer equally to things present, past,
 and future; nevertheless the present, past, and future; nevertheless
 the present, past, and future do not bear the same relations to the
 species. Present things have a nature according to which they
 resemble the species in the mind of an angel: and so they can be
 known thereby. Things which are yet to come have not yet a nature
 whereby they are likened to such species; consequently, they cannot
 be known by those species.
"," Things distant according to place are already existing
 in nature; and share in some species, whose image is in the angel;
 whereas this is not true of future things, as has been stated.
 Consequently there is no comparison.

","Whether Angels Know Secret Thoughts?
"," It would seem that the angels know secret thoughts. For
 Gregory (Moral. xviii), explaining Job 28:17: ""Gold or crystal cannot
 equal it,"" says that ""then,"" namely in the bliss of those rising from
 the dead, ""one shall be as evident to another as he is to himself, and
 when once the mind of each is seen, his conscience will at the same
 time be penetrated."" But those who rise shall be like the angels, as
 is stated (Matt. 22:30). Therefore an angel can see what is in
 another's conscience.
"," Further, intelligible species bear the same relation to the
 intellect as shapes do to bodies. But when the body is seen its shape
 is seen. Therefore, when an intellectual substance is seen, the
 intelligible species within it is also seen. Consequently, when one
 angel beholds another, or even a soul, it seems that he can see the
 thoughts of both.
"," Further, the ideas of our intellect resemble the angel more
 than do the images in our imagination; because the former are
 actually understood, while the latter are understood only
 potentially. But the images in our imagination can be known by an
 angel as corporeal things are known: because the imagination is a
 corporeal faculty. Therefore it seems that an angel can know the
 thoughts of the intellect.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," In the present life one man's thought is not known
 by another owing to a twofold hindrance; namely, on account of the
 grossness of the body, and because the will shuts up its secrets.
 The first obstacle will be removed at the Resurrection, and does not
 exist at all in the angels; while the second will remain, and is in
 the angels now. Nevertheless the brightness of the body will show
 forth the quality of the soul; as to its amount of grace and of
 glory. In this way one will be able to see the mind of another.
"," Although one angel sees the intelligible species of
 another, by the fact that the species are proportioned to the rank of
 these substances according to greater or lesser universality, yet it
 does not follow that one knows how far another makes use of them by
 actual consideration.
"," The appetite of the brute does not control its act, but
 follows the impression of some other corporeal or spiritual cause.
 Since, therefore, the angels know corporeal things and their
 dispositions, they can thereby know what is passing in the appetite
 or in the imaginative apprehension of the brute beasts, and even of
 man, in so far as the sensitive appetite sometimes, through following
 some bodily impression, influences his conduct, as always happens in
 brutes. Yet the angels do not necessarily know the movement of the
 sensitive appetite and the imaginative apprehension of man in so far
 as these are moved by the will and reason; because, even the lower
 part of the soul has some share of reason, as obeying its ruler, as
 is said in Ethics iii, 12. But it does not follow that, if the
 angel knows what is passing through man's sensitive appetite or
 imagination, he knows what is in the thought or will: because the
 intellect or will is not subject to the sensitive appetite or the
 imagination, but can make various uses of them.

","Whether the Angels Know the Mysteries of Grace?

 For, the mystery of the Incarnation is the most excellent of all
 mysteries. But the angels knew of it from the beginning; for Augustine
 says (Gen. ad lit. v, 19): ""This mystery was hidden in God through the
 ages, yet so that it was known to the princes and powers in heavenly
 places."" And the Apostle says (1 Tim. 3:16): ""That great mystery of
 godliness appeared unto angels*."" [*Vulg.: 'Great is the mystery of
 godliness, which . . . appeared unto angels.'] Therefore the angels
 know the mysteries of grace.
"," Further, the reasons of all mysteries of grace are contained
 in the Divine wisdom. But the angels behold God's wisdom, which is
 His essence. Therefore they know the mysteries of grace.
"," Further, the prophets are enlightened by the angels, as is
 clear from Dionysius (Coel. Hier. iv). But the prophets knew
 mysteries of grace; for it is said (Amos 3:7): ""For the Lord God doth
 nothing without revealing His secret to His servants the prophets.""
 Therefore angels know the mysteries of grace.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," One can speak in two ways of the mystery of the
 Incarnation. First of all, in general; and in this way it was
 revealed to all from the commencement of their beatitude. The reason
 of this is, that this is a kind of general principle to which all
 their duties are ordered. For ""all are [*Vulg.: 'Are they not all.']
 ministering spirits, sent to minister for them who shall receive the
 inheritance of salvation"" (Heb. 1:14); and this is brought about by
 the mystery of the Incarnation. Hence it was necessary for all of
 them to be instructed in this mystery from the very beginning.
"," Although the angels in bliss behold the Divine wisdom,
 yet they do not comprehend it. So it is not necessary for them to
 know everything hidden in it.
"," Whatever the prophets knew by revelation of the
 mysteries of grace, was revealed in a more excellent way to the
 angels. And although God revealed in general to the prophets what He
 was one day to do regarding the salvation of the human race, still
 the apostles knew some particulars of the same, which the prophets
 did not know. Thus we read (Eph. 3:4, 5): ""As you reading, may
 understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ, which in other
 generations was not known to the sons of men, as it is now revealed
 to His holy apostles."" Among the prophets also, the later ones knew
 what the former did not know; according to Ps. 118:100: ""I have had
 understanding above ancients,"" and Gregory says: ""The knowledge of
 Divine things increased as time went on"" (Hom. xvi in Ezech.).

","Whether the Angel's Intellect Is Sometimes in Potentiality, Sometimes

 in potentiality, as stated in Phys. iii, 6. But the angels' minds
 are moved by understanding, as Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv).
 Therefore the angelic minds are sometimes in potentiality.
"," Further, since desire is of a thing not possessed but
 possible to have, whoever desires to know anything is in potentiality

 But the angel's intelligence has some admixture of potentiality.
 Therefore it sometimes understands potentially.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Movement is taken there not as the act of something
 imperfect, that is, of something existing in potentiality, but as the
 act of something perfect, that is, of one actually existing. In this
 way understanding and feeling are termed movements, as stated in De
 Anima iii, text. 28.
"," Such desire on the part of the angels does not exclude
 the object desired, but weariness thereof. Or they are said to desire
 the vision of God with regard to fresh revelations, which they
 receive from God to fit them for the tasks which they have to perform.
"," In the angel's substance there is no potentiality
 divested of act. In the same way, the angel's intellect is never so
 in potentiality as to be without act.

","Whether an Angel Can Understand Many Things at the Same Time?
"," It would seem that an angel cannot understand many things
 at the same time. For the Philosopher says (Topic. ii, 4) that ""it may
 happen that we know many things, but understand only one.""
"," Further, nothing is understood unless the intellect be
 informed by an intelligible species; just at the body is formed by
 shape. But one body cannot be formed into many shapes. Therefore
 neither can one intellect simultaneously understand various
 intelligible things.
"," Further, to understand is a kind of movement. But no movement
 terminates in various terms. Therefore many things cannot be
 understood altogether.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," To understand many things as one, is, so to
 speak, to understand one thing.
"," The intellect is informed by the intelligible
 species which it has within it. So it can behold at the same time many
 intelligible objects under one species; as one body can by one shape
 be likened to many bodies.

292,"[I, Q. 58, Art. 3]
","Whether an Angel's Knowledge Is Discursive?
"," It would seem that the knowledge of an angel is
 discursive. For the discursive movement of the mind comes from one
 thing being known through another. But the angels know one thing
 through another; for they know creatures through the Word. Therefore
 the intellect of an angel knows by discursive method.
"," Further, whatever a lower power can do, the higher can do.
 But the human intellect can syllogize, and know causes in effects;
 all of which is the discursive method. Therefore the intellect of the
 angel, which is higher in the order of nature, can with greater
 reason do this.
"," Further, Isidore (De sum. bono i, 10) says that ""demons learn
 more things by experience."" But experimental knowledge is discursive:
 for, ""one experience comes of many remembrances, and one universal from
 many experiences,"" as Aristotle observes (Poster. ii; Metaph. vii).
 Therefore an angel's knowledge is discursive.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Discursion expresses movement of a kind. Now all
 movement is from something before to something after. Hence
 discursive knowledge comes about according as from something
 previously known one attains to the knowledge of what is afterwards
 known, and which was previously unknown. But if in the thing
 perceived something else be seen at the same time, as an object and
 its image are seen simultaneously in a mirror, it is not discursive
 knowledge. And in this way the angels know things in the Word.
"," The angels can syllogize, in the sense of knowing a
 syllogism; and they see effects in causes, and causes in effects: yet
 they do not acquire knowledge of an unknown truth in this way, by
 syllogizing from causes to effect, or from effect to cause.
"," Experience is affirmed of angels and demons simply by
 way of similitude, forasmuch as they know sensible things which are
 present, yet without any discursion withal.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
293,"[I, Q. 58, Art. 4]
","Whether the Angels Understand by Composing and Dividing?
"," It would seem that the angels understand by composing and
 dividing. For, where there is multiplicity of things understood, there
 is composition of the same, as is said in De Anima iii, text. 21. But
 there is a multitude of things understood in the angelic mind; because
 angels apprehend different things by various species, and not all at
 one time. Therefore there is composition and division in the angel's
 mind.
"," Further, negation is far more remote from affirmation than
 any two opposite natures are; because the first of distinctions is
 that of affirmation and negation. But the angel knows certain distant
 natures not by one, but by diverse species, as is evident from what
 was said (A. 2). Therefore he must know affirmation and negation by
 diverse species. And so it seems that he understands by composing and
 dividing.
"," Further, speech is a sign of the intellect. But in speaking
 to men, angels use affirmative and negative expressions, which are
 signs of composition and of division in the intellect; as is manifest
 from many passages of Sacred Scripture. Therefore it seems that the
 angel understands by composing and dividing.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Not every multitude of things understood causes
 composition, but a multitude of such things understood that one of
 them is attributed to, or denied of, another. When an angel apprehends
 the nature of anything, he at the same time understands whatever can
 be either attributed to it, or denied of it. Hence, in apprehending a
 nature, he by one simple perception grasps all that we can learn by
 composing and dividing.
"," The various natures of things differ less as to their
 mode of existing than do affirmation and negation. Yet, as to the way
 in which they are known, affirmation and negation have something more
 in common; because directly the truth of an affirmation is known, the
 falsehood of the opposite negation is known also.
"," The fact that angels use affirmative and negative forms
 of speech, shows that they know both composition and division: yet
 not that they know by composing and dividing, but by knowing simply
 the nature of a thing.

","Whether There Can Be Falsehood in the Intellect of an Angel?
"," It would seem that there can be falsehood in the angel's
 intellect. For perversity appertains to falsehood. But, as Dionysius
 says (Div. Nom. iv), there is ""a perverted fancy"" in the demons.
 Therefore it seems that there can be falsehood in the intellect of
 the angels.
"," Further, nescience is the cause of estimating falsely. But,
 as Dionysius says (Eccl. Hier. vi), there can be nescience in the
 angels. Therefore it seems there can be falsehood in them.
"," Further, everything which falls short of the truth of wisdom,
 and which has a depraved reason, has falsehood or error in its
 intellect. But Dionysius (Div. Nom. vii) affirms this of the demons.
 Therefore it seems that there can be error in the minds of the angels.

295,"[I, Q. 58, A. 6]
","Whether There Is a ""Morning"" and an ""Evening"" Knowledge in the
"," It would seem that there is neither an evening nor a
 morning knowledge in the angels; because evening and morning have an
 admixture of darkness. But there is no darkness in the knowledge of
 an angel; since there is no error nor falsehood. Therefore the
 angelic knowledge ought not to be termed morning and evening
 knowledge.
"," Further, between evening and morning the night intervenes;
 while noonday falls between morning and evening. Consequently, if
 there be a morning and an evening knowledge in the angels, for the
 same reason it appears that there ought to be a noonday and a night
 knowledge.
"," Further, knowledge is diversified according to the difference
 of the objects known: hence the Philosopher says (De Anima iii, text.
 38), ""The sciences are divided just as things are."" But there is a
 threefold existence of things: to wit, in the Word; in their own
 natures; and in the angelic knowledge, as Augustine observes (Gen. ad
 lit. ii, 8). If, therefore, a morning and an evening knowledge be
 admitted in the angels, because of the existence of things in the
 Word, and in their own nature, then there ought to be admitted a
 third class of knowledge, on account of the existence of things in
 the angelic mind.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Evening and morning knowledge in the angelic knowledge
 are not taken as compared to an admixture of darkness, but as
 compared to beginning and end. Or else it can be said, as Augustine
 puts it (Gen. ad lit. iv, 23), that there is nothing to prevent us
 from calling something light in comparison with one thing, and
 darkness with respect to another. In the same way the life of the
 faithful and the just is called light in comparison with the wicked,
 according to Eph. 5:8: ""You were heretofore darkness; but now, light
 in the Lord"": yet this very life of the faithful, when set in
 contrast to the life of glory, is termed darkness, according to 2
 Pet. 1:19: ""You have the firm prophetic word, whereunto you do well
 to attend, as to a light that shineth in a dark place."" So the
 angel's knowledge by which he knows things in their own nature, is
 day in comparison with ignorance or error; yet it is dark in
 comparison with the vision of the Word.
"," The morning and evening knowledge belong to the day,
 that is, to the enlightened angels, who are quite apart from the
 darkness, that is, from the evil spirits. The good angels, while
 knowing the creature, do not adhere to it, for that would be to turn
 to darkness and to night; but they refer this back to the praise of
 God, in Whom, as in their principle, they know all things.
 Consequently after ""evening"" there is no night, but ""morning""; so
 that morning is the end of the preceding day, and the beginning of
 the following, in so far as the angels refer to God's praise their
 knowledge of the preceding work. Noonday is comprised under the name
 of day, as the middle between the two extremes. Or else the noon can
 be referred to their knowledge of God Himself, Who has neither
 beginning nor end.
"," The angels themselves are also creatures. Accordingly
 the existence of things in the angelic knowledge is comprised under
 evening knowledge, as also the existence of things in their own
 nature.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
296,"[I, Q. 58, Art. 7]
","Whether the Morning and Evening Knowledge Are One?
"," It would seem that the morning and the evening knowledge
 are one. For it is said (Gen. 1:5): ""There was evening and morning, one
 day."" But by the expression ""day"" the knowledge of the angels is to be
 understood, as Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. iv, 23). Therefore the
 morning and evening knowledge of the angels are one and the same.
"," Further, it is impossible for one faculty to have two
 operations at the same time. But the angels are always using their
 morning knowledge; because they are always beholding God and things in
 God, according to Matt. 18:10. Therefore, if the evening knowledge were
 different from the morning, the angel could never exercise his evening
 knowledge.
"," Further, the Apostle says (1 Cor. 13:10): ""When that which is
 perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away."" But,
 if the evening knowledge be different from the morning, it is
 compared to it as the less perfect to the perfect. Therefore the
 evening knowledge cannot exist together with the morning knowledge.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The six days, as Augustine understands them, are taken
 as the six classes of things known by the angels; so that the day's
 unit is taken according to the unit of the thing understood; which,
 nevertheless, can be apprehended by various ways of knowing it.
"," There can be two operations of the same faculty at the
 one time, one of which is referred to the other; as is evident when
 the will at the same time wills the end and the means to the end; and
 the intellect at the same instant perceives principles and
 conclusions through those principles, when it has already acquired
 knowledge. As Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. iv, 24), the evening
 knowledge is referred to the morning knowledge in the angels; hence
 there is nothing to hinder both from being at the same time in the
 angels.
"," On the coming of what is perfect, the opposite
 imperfect is done away: just as faith, which is of the things that
 are not seen, is made void when vision succeeds. But the imperfection
 of the evening knowledge is not opposed to the perfection of the
 morning knowledge. For that a thing be known in itself, is not
 opposite to its being known in its cause. Nor, again, is there any
 inconsistency in knowing a thing through two mediums, one of which is
 more perfect and the other less perfect; just as we can have a
 demonstrative and a probable medium for reaching the same conclusion.
 In like manner a thing can be known by the angel through the
 uncreated Word, and through an innate idea.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
297,"[I, Q. 59, Art. 1]
","Whether There Is Will in the Angels?
"," It would seem that there is no will in the angels. For
 as the Philosopher says (De Anima iii, text. 42), ""The will is in the
 reason."" But there is no reason in the angels, but something higher
 than reason. Therefore there is no will in the angels, but something
 higher than the will.
"," Further, the will is comprised under the appetite, as is
 evident from the Philosopher (De Anima iii, text. 42). But the
 appetite argues something imperfect; because it is a desire of
 something not as yet possessed. Therefore, since there is no
 imperfection in the angels, especially in the blessed ones, it
 seems that there is no will in them.
"," Further, the Philosopher says (De Anima ii, text. 54) that
 the will is a mover which is moved; for it is moved by the appetible
 object understood. Now the angels are immovable, since they are
 incorporeal. Therefore there is no will in the angels.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Reason surpasses sense in a different way from that in
 which intellect surpasses reason. Reason surpasses sense according to
 the diversity of the objects known; for sense judges of particular
 objects, while reason judges of universals. Therefore there must be
 one appetite tending towards good in the abstract, which appetite
 belongs to reason; and another with a tendency towards particular
 good, which appetite belongs to sense. But intellect and reason
 differ as to their manner of knowing; because the intellect knows by
 simple intuition, while reason knows by a process of discursion from
 one thing to another. Nevertheless by such discursion reason comes to
 know what intellect learns without it, namely, the universal.
 Consequently the object presented to the appetitive faculty on the
 part of reason and on the part of intellect is the same. Therefore in
 the angels, who are purely intellectual, there is no appetite higher
 than the will.
"," Although the name of the appetitive part is derived
 from seeking things not yet possessed, yet the appetitive part
 reaches out not to these things only, but also to many other things;
 thus the name of a stone [lapis] is derived from injuring the foot
 [laesione pedis], though not this alone belongs to a stone. In the
 same way the irascible faculty is so denominated from anger [ira];
 though at the same time there are several other passions in it, as
 hope, daring, and the rest.
"," The will is called a mover which is moved, according as
 to will and to understand are termed movements of a kind; and there
 is nothing to prevent movement of this kind from existing in the
 angels, since such movement is the act of a perfect agent, as stated
 in De Anima iii, text. 28.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
298,"[I, Q. 59, Art. 2]
","Whether in the Angels the Will Differs from the Intellect?
"," It would seem that in the angel the will does not differ
 from the intellect and from the nature. For an angel is more simple
 than a natural body. But a natural body is inclined through its form
 towards its end, which is its good. Therefore much more so is the
 angel. Now the angel's form is either the nature in which he subsists,
 or else it is some species within his intellect. Therefore the angel
 inclines towards the good through his own nature, or through an
 intelligible species. But such inclination towards the good belongs to
 the will. Therefore the will of the angel does not differ from his
 nature or his intellect.
"," Further, the object of the intellect is the true, while the
 object of the will is the good. Now the good and the true differ,
 not really but only logically [*Cf. Q. 16, A. 4]. Therefore will
 and intellect are not really different.
"," Further, the distinction of common and proper does not
 differentiate the faculties; for the same power of sight perceives
 color and whiteness. But the good and the true seem to be mutually
 related as common to particular; for the true is a particular good, to
 wit, of the intellect. Therefore the will, whose object is the good,
 does not differ from the intellect, whose object is the true.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," A natural body is moved to its own being by its
 substantial form: while it is inclined to something outside by
 something additional, as has been said.
"," Faculties are not differentiated by any material
 difference of their objects, but according to their formal
 distinction, which is taken from the nature of the object as such.
 Consequently the diversity derived from the notion of good and true
 suffices for the difference of intellect from will.
"," Because the good and the true are really convertible,
 it follows that the good is apprehended by the intellect as something
 true; while the true is desired by the will as something good.
 Nevertheless, the diversity of their aspects is sufficient for
 diversifying the faculties, as was said above (ad 2).
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
299,"[I, Q. 59, Art. 3]
","Whether There Is Free-Will in the Angels?
"," It would seem that there is no free-will in the angels.
 For the act of free-will is to choose. But there can be no choice
 with the angels, because choice is ""the desire of something after
 taking counsel,"" while counsel is ""a kind of inquiry,"" as stated in
 Ethic. iii, 3. But the angels' knowledge is not the result of
 inquiring, for this belongs to the discursiveness of reason.
 Therefore it appears that there is no free-will in the angels.
"," Further, free-will implies indifference to alternatives.
 But in the angels on the part of their intellect there is no such
 indifference; because, as was observed already (Q. 58, A. 5),
 their intellect is not deceived as to things which are naturally
 intelligible to them. Therefore neither on the part of their
 appetitive faculty can there be free-will.
"," Further, the natural endowments of the angels belong to them
 according to degrees of more or less; because in the higher angels
 the intellectual nature is more perfect than in the lower. But the
 free-will does not admit of degrees. Therefore there is no free-will
 in them.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The Philosopher is speaking of choice, as it is in man.
 As a man's estimate in speculative matters differs from an angel's in
 this, that the one needs not to inquire, while the other does so
 need; so is it in practical matters. Hence there is choice in the
 angels, yet not with the inquisitive deliberation of counsel, but by
 the sudden acceptance of truth.
"," As was observed already (A. 2), knowledge is effected
 by the presence of the known within the knower. Now it is a mark of
 imperfection in anything not to have within it what it should
 naturally have. Consequently an angel would not be perfect in his
 nature, if his intellect were not determined to every truth which he
 can know naturally. But the act of the appetitive faculty comes of
 this, that the affection is directed to something outside. Yet the
 perfection of a thing does not come from everything to which it is
 inclined, but only from something which is higher than it. Therefore
 it does not argue imperfection in an angel if his will be not
 determined with regard to things beneath him; but it would argue
 imperfection in him, were he to be indeterminate to what is above him.
"," Free-will exists in a nobler manner in the higher
 angels than it does in the lower, as also does the judgment of the
 intellect. Yet it is true that liberty, in so far as the removal of
 compulsion is considered, is not susceptible of greater and less
 degree; because privations and negations are not lessened nor
 increased directly of themselves; but only by their cause, or
 through the addition of some qualification.

","Whether There Is an Irascible and a Concupiscible Appetite in the
"," It would seem that there is an irascible and a
 concupiscible appetite in the angels. For Dionysius says (Div. Nom.
 iv) that in the demons there is ""unreasonable fury and wild
 concupiscence."" But demons are of the same nature as angels; for sin
 has not altered their nature. Therefore there is an irascible and a
 concupiscible appetite in the angels.
"," Further, love and joy are in the concupiscible; while anger,
 hope, and fear are in the irascible appetite. But in the Sacred
 Scriptures these things are attributed both to the good and to the
 wicked angels. Therefore there is an irascible and a concupiscible
 appetite in the angels.
"," Further, some virtues are said to reside in the irascible
 appetite and some in the concupiscible: thus charity and temperance
 appear to be in the concupiscible, while hope and fortitude are in the
 irascible. But these virtues are in the angels. Therefore there is
 both a concupiscible and an irascible appetite in the angels.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Fury and concupiscence are metaphorically said to be in
 the demons, as anger is sometimes attributed to God;--on account of
 the resemblance in the effect.
"," Love and joy, in so far as they are passions, are in
 the concupiscible appetite, but in so far as they express a simple
 act of the will, they are in the intellective part: in this sense to
 love is to wish well to anyone; and to be glad is for the will to
 repose in some good possessed. Universally speaking, none of these
 things is said of the angels, as by way of passions; as Augustine
 says (De Civ. Dei ix).
"," Charity, as a virtue, is not in the concupiscible
 appetite, but in the will; because the object of the concupiscible
 appetite is the good as delectable to the senses. But the Divine
 goodness, which is the object of charity, is not of any such kind.
 For the same reason it must be said that hope does not exist in the
 irascible appetite; because the object of the irascible appetite is
 something arduous belonging to the sensible order, which the virtue
 of hope does not regard; since the object of hope is arduous and
 divine. Temperance, however, considered as a human virtue, deals with
 the desires of sensible pleasures, which belong to the concupiscible
 faculty. Similarly, fortitude regulates daring and fear, which reside
 in the irascible part. Consequently temperance, in so far as it is a
 human virtue, resides in the concupiscible part, and fortitude in the
 irascible. But they do not exist in the angels in this manner. For in
 them there are no passions of concupiscence, nor of fear and daring,
 to be regulated by temperance and fortitude. But temperance is
 predicated of them according as in moderation they display their will
 in conformity with the Divine will. Fortitude is likewise attributed
 to them, in so far as they firmly carry out the Divine will. All of
 this is done by their will, and not by the irascible or concupiscible
 appetite.

","Whether There Is Natural Love or Dilection in an Angel?
"," It would seem that there is no natural love or dilection
 in the angels. For, natural love is contradistinguished from
 intellectual love, as stated by Dionysius (Div. Nom. iv). But an
 angel's love is intellectual. Therefore it is not natural.
"," Further, those who love with natural love are more acted
 upon than active in themselves; for nothing has control over its own
 nature. Now the angels are not acted upon, but act of themselves;
 because they possess free-will, as was shown above (Q. 59, A. 3).
 Consequently there is no natural love in them.
"," Further, every love is either ordinate or inordinate. Now
 ordinate love belongs to charity; while inordinate love belongs to
 wickedness. But neither of these belongs to nature; because charity is
 above nature, while wickedness is against nature. Therefore there is
 no natural love in the angels.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Intellectual love is contradistinguished from that
 natural love, which is merely natural, in so far as it belongs to a
 nature which has not likewise the perfection of either sense or
 intellect.
"," All things in the world are moved to act by something
 else except the First Agent, Who acts in such a manner that He is in
 no way moved to act by another; and in Whom nature and will are the
 same. So there is nothing unfitting in an angel being moved to act in
 so far as such natural inclination is implanted in him by the Author
 of his nature. Yet he is not so moved to act that he does not act
 himself, because he has free-will.
"," As natural knowledge is always true, so is natural love
 well regulated; because natural love is nothing else than the
 inclination implanted in nature by its Author. To say that a natural
 inclination is not well regulated, is to derogate from the Author of
 nature. Yet the rectitude of natural love is different from the
 rectitude of charity and virtue: because the one rectitude perfects
 the other; even so the truth of natural knowledge is of one kind, and
 the truth of infused or acquired knowledge is of another.

302,"[I, Q. 60, Art. 2]
","Whether There Is Love of Choice in the Angels?
"," It would seem that there is no love of choice in the
 angels. For love of choice appears to be rational love; since choice
 follows counsel, which lies in inquiry, as stated in Ethic. iii, 3.
 Now rational love is contrasted with intellectual, which is proper to
 angels, as is said (Div. Nom. iv). Therefore there is no love of
 choice in the angels.
"," Further, the angels have only natural knowledge besides such
 as is infused: since they do not proceed from principles to acquire
 the knowledge of conclusions. Hence they are disposed to everything
 they can know, as our intellect is disposed towards first principles,
 which it can know naturally. Now love follows knowledge, as has been
 already stated (A. 1; Q. 16, A. 1). Consequently, besides their
 infused love, there is only natural love in the angels. Therefore
 there is no love of choice in them.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Not all love of choice is rational love, according as
 rational is distinguished from intellectual love. For rational love
 is so called which follows deductive knowledge: but, as was said
 above (Q. 59, A. 3, ad 1), when treating of free-will, every choice
 does not follow a discursive act of the reason; but only human
 choice. Consequently the conclusion does not follow.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
303,"[I, Q. 60, Art. 4]
","Whether the Angel Loves Himself with Both Natural Love, and Love of
"," It would seem that the angel does not love himself both
 with natural love and a love of choice. For, as was said (A. 2),
 natural love regards the end itself; while love of choice regards the
 means to the end. But the same thing, with regard to the same, cannot
 be both the end and a means to the end. Therefore natural love and the
 love of choice cannot have the same object.
"," Further, as Dionysius observes (Div. Nom. iv): ""Love is a
 uniting and a binding power."" But uniting and binding imply various
 things brought together. Therefore the angel cannot love himself.
"," Further, love is a kind of movement. But every movement
 tends towards something else. Therefore it seems that an angel
 cannot love himself with either natural or elective love.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," It is not under the same but under quite different
 aspects that an angel or a man loves self with natural and with
 elective love, as was observed above.
"," As to be one is better than to be united, so there is
 more oneness in love which is directed to self than in love which
 unites one to others. Dionysius used the terms ""uniting"" and
 ""binding"" in order to show the derivation of love from self to things
 outside self; as uniting is derived from unity.
"," As love is an action which remains within the agent, so
 also is it a movement which abides within the lover, but does not of
 necessity tend towards something else; yet it can be reflected back
 upon the lover so that he loves himself; just as knowledge is
 reflected back upon the knower, in such a way that he knows himself.

304,"[I, Q. 60, Art. 4]
","Whether an Angel Loves Another with Natural Love As He Loves Himself?
"," It would seem that an angel does not love another with
 natural love as he loves himself. For love follows knowledge. But an
 angel does not know another as he knows himself: because he knows
 himself by his essence, while he knows another by his similitude, as
 was said above (Q. 56, AA. 1, 2). Therefore it seems that one angel
 does not love another with natural love as he loves himself.
"," Further, the cause is more powerful than the effect; and the
 principle than what is derived from it. But love for another comes of
 love for self, as the Philosopher says (Ethic. ix, 8). Therefore one
 angel does not love another as himself, but loves himself more.
"," Further, natural love is of something as an end, and is
 unremovable. But no angel is the end of another; and again, such love
 can be severed from him, as is the case with the demons, who have no
 love for the good angels. Therefore an angel does not love another
 with natural love as he loves himself.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The expression 'as himself' can in one way qualify the
 knowledge and the love on the part of the one known and loved: and
 thus one angel knows another as himself, because he knows the other
 to be even as he knows himself to be. In another way the expression
 can qualify the knowledge and the love on the part of the knower and
 lover. And thus one angel does not know another as himself, because
 he knows himself by his essence, and the other not by the other's
 essence. In like manner he does not love another as he loves himself,
 because he loves himself by his own will; but he does not love
 another by the other's will.
"," The expression ""as"" does not denote equality, but
 likeness. For since natural affection rests upon natural unity, the
 angel naturally loves less what is less one with him. Consequently he
 loves more what is numerically one with himself, than what is one
 only generically or specifically. But it is natural for him to have a
 like love for another as for himself, in this respect, that as he
 loves self in wishing well to self, so he loves another in wishing
 well to him.
"," Natural love is said to be of the end, not as of that
 end to which good is willed, but rather as of that good which one
 wills for oneself, and in consequence for another, as united to
 oneself. Nor can such natural love be stripped from the wicked
 angels, without their still retaining a natural affection towards the
 good angels, in so far as they share the same nature with them. But
 they hate them, in so far as they are unlike them according to
 righteousness and unrighteousness.

305,"[I, Q. 60, Art. 5]
","Whether an angel by natural love loves God more than he loves himself?
"," It would seem that the angel does not love God by
 natural love more than he loves himself. For, as was stated (A. 4),
 natural love rests upon natural union. Now the Divine nature is far
 above the angelic nature. Therefore, according to natural love, the
 angel loves God less than self, or even than another angel.
"," Further, ""That on account of which a thing is such, is yet
 more so."" But every one loves another with natural love for his own
 sake: because one thing loves another as good for itself. Therefore
 the angel does not love God more than self with natural love.
"," Further, nature is self-centered in its operation; for we
 behold every agent acting naturally for its own preservation. But
 nature's operation would not be self-centered were it to tend towards
 anything else more than to nature itself. Therefore the angel does
 not love God more than himself from natural love.
"," Further, it is proper to charity to love God more than self.
 But to love from charity is not natural to the angels; for ""it is
 poured out upon their hearts by the Holy Spirit Who is given to
 them,"" as Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xii, 9). Therefore the angels
 do not love God more than themselves by natural love.
"," Further, natural love lasts while nature endures. But the
 love of God more than self does not remain in the angel or man who
 sins; for Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xiv), ""Two loves have made two
 cities; namely love of self unto the contempt of God has made the
 earthly city; while love of God unto the contempt of self has made
 the heavenly city."" Therefore it is not natural to love God more
 than self.
",,,,,,,,,,,,," Such reasoning holds good of things adequately divided
 whereof one is not the cause of the existence and goodness of the
 other; for in such natures each loves itself naturally more than it
 does the other, inasmuch as it is more one with itself than it is
 with the other. But where one is the whole cause of the existence and
 goodness of the other, that one is naturally more loved than self;
 because, as we said above, each part naturally loves the whole more
 than itself: and each individual naturally loves the good of the
 species more than its own individual good. Now God is not only the
 good of one species, but is absolutely the universal good; hence
 everything in its own way naturally loves God more than itself.
"," When it is said that God is loved by an angel ""in so
 far"" as He is good to the angel, if the expression ""in so far""
 denotes an end, then it is false; for he does not naturally love God
 for his own good, but for God's sake. If it denotes the nature of
 love on the lover's part, then it is true; for it would not be in the
 nature of anyone to love God, except from this--that everything is
 dependent on that good which is God.
"," Nature's operation is self-centered not merely as to
 certain particular details, but much more as to what is common; for
 everything is inclined to preserve not merely its individuality, but
 likewise its species. And much more has everything a natural
 inclination towards what is the absolutely universal good.
"," God, in so far as He is the universal good, from Whom
 every natural good depends, is loved by everything with natural love.
 So far as He is the good which of its very nature beatifies all with
 supernatural beatitude, He is love with the love of charity.
"," Since God's substance and universal goodness are one
 and the same, all who behold God's essence are by the same movement
 of love moved towards the Divine essence as it is distinct from other
 things, and according as it is the universal good. And because He is
 naturally loved by all so far as He is the universal good, it is
 impossible that whoever sees Him in His essence should not love Him.
 But such as do not behold His essence, know Him by some particular
 effects, which are sometimes opposed to their will. So in this way
 they are said to hate God; yet nevertheless, so far as He is the
 universal good of all, every thing naturally loves God more than
 itself.

","Whether the Angels Have a Cause of Their Existence?
"," It would seem that the angels have no cause of their
 existence. For the first chapter of Genesis treats of things created
 by God. But there is no mention of angels. Therefore the angels were
 not created by God.
"," Further, the Philosopher says (Metaph. viii, text. 16) that
 if any substance be a form without matter, ""straightway it has being
 and unity of itself, and has no cause of its being and unity."" But
 the angels are immaterial forms, as was shown above (Q. 50, A. 2).
 Therefore they have no cause of their being.
"," Further, whatever is produced by any agent, from the very
 fact of its being produced, receives form from it. But since the
 angels are forms, they do not derive their form from any agent.
 Therefore the angels have no active cause.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xi, 50) that the angels
 were not passed over in that account of the first creation of things,
 but are designated by the name ""heavens"" or of ""light."" And they were
 either passed over, or else designated by the names of corporeal
 things, because Moses was addressing an uncultured people, as yet
 incapable of understanding an incorporeal nature; and if it had been
 divulged that there were creatures existing beyond corporeal nature,
 it would have proved to them an occasion of idolatry, to which they
 were inclined, and from which Moses especially meant to safeguard
 them.
"," Substances that are subsisting forms have no 'formal'
 cause of their existence and unity, nor such active cause as produces
 its effect by changing the matter from a state of potentiality to
 actuality; but they have a cause productive of their entire substance.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
307,"[I, Q. 61, Art. 2]
","Whether the Angel Was Produced by God from Eternity?
"," It would seem that the angel was produced by God from
 eternity. For God is the cause of the angel by His being: for He does
 not act through something besides His essence. But His being is
 eternal. Therefore He produced the angels from eternity.
"," Further, everything which exists at one period and not at
 another, is subject to time. But the angel is above time, as is laid
 down in the book De Causis. Therefore the angel is not at one time
 existing and at another non-existing, but exists always.
"," Further, Augustine (De Trin. xiii) proves the soul's
 incorruptibility by the fact that the mind is capable of truth. But as
 truth is incorruptible, so is it eternal. Therefore the intellectual
 nature of the soul and of the angel is not only incorruptible, but
 likewise eternal.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," God's being is His will. So the fact that God produced
 the angels and other creatures by His being does not exclude that He
 made them also by His will. But, as was shown above (Q. 19, A. 3; Q.
 46, A. 1), God's will does not act by necessity in producing
 creatures. Therefore He produced such as He willed, and when He
 willed.
"," An angel is above that time which is the measure of the
 movement of the heavens; because he is above every movement of a
 corporeal nature. Nevertheless he is not above time which is the
 measure of the succession of his existence after his non-existence,
 and which is also the measure of the succession which is in his
 operations. Hence Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. viii, 20,21) that ""God
 moves the spiritual creature according to time.""
"," Angels and intelligent souls are incorruptible by the
 very fact of their having a nature whereby they are capable of truth.
 But they did not possess this nature from eternity; it was bestowed
 upon them when God Himself willed it. Consequently it does not follow
 that the angels existed from eternity.

308,"[I, Q. 61, Art. 3]
","Whether the Angels Were Created Before the Corporeal World?
"," It would seem that the angels were created before the
 corporeal world. For Jerome says (In Ep. ad Tit. i, 2): ""Six thousand
 years of our time have not yet elapsed; yet how shall we measure the
 time, how shall we count the ages, in which the Angels, Thrones,
 Dominations, and the other orders served God?"" Damascene also says
 (De Fide Orth. ii): ""Some say that the angels were begotten before
 all creation; as Gregory the Theologian declares, He first of all
 devised the angelic and heavenly powers, and the devising was the
 making thereof.""
"," Further, the angelic nature stands midway between the Divine
 and the corporeal natures. But the Divine nature is from eternity;
 while corporeal nature is from time. Therefore the angelic nature was
 produced ere time was made, and after eternity.
"," Further, the angelic nature is more remote from the corporeal
 nature than one corporeal nature is from another. But one corporeal
 nature was made before another; hence the six days of the production
 of things are set forth in the opening of Genesis. Much more,
 therefore, was the angelic nature made before every corporeal nature.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Jerome is speaking according to the teaching of the
 Greek Fathers; all of whom hold the creation of the angels to have
 taken place previously to that of the corporeal world.
"," God is not a part of, but far above, the whole
 universe, possessing within Himself the entire perfection of the
 universe in a more eminent way. But an angel is a part of the
 universe. Hence the comparison does not hold.
"," All corporeal creatures are one in matter; while the
 angels do not agree with them in matter. Consequently the creation
 of the matter of the corporeal creature involves in a manner the
 creation of all things; but the creation of the angels does not
 involve creation of the universe.

309,"[I, Q. 61, Art. 4]
","Whether the Angels Were Created in the Empyrean Heaven?
"," It would seem that the angels were not created in the
 empyrean heaven. For the angels are incorporeal substances. Now a
 substance which is incorporeal is not dependent upon a body for its
 existence; and as a consequence, neither is it for its creation.
 Therefore the angels were not created in any corporeal place.
"," Further, Augustine remarks (Gen. ad lit. iii, 10), that the
 angels were created in the upper atmosphere: therefore not in the
 empyrean heaven.
"," Further, the empyrean heaven is said to be the highest
 heaven. If therefore the angels were created in the empyrean heaven,
 it would not beseem them to mount up to a still higher heaven. And
 this is contrary to what is said in Isaias, speaking in the person of
 the sinning angel: ""I will ascend into heaven"" (Isa. 14:13).
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The angels were created in a corporeal place, not as
 if depending upon a body either as to their existence or as to their
 being made; because God could have created them before all corporeal
 creation, as many holy Doctors hold. They were made in a corporeal
 place in order to show their relationship to corporeal nature, and
 that they are by their power in touch with bodies.
"," By the uppermost atmosphere Augustine possibly means
 the highest part of heaven, to which the atmosphere has a kind of
 affinity owing to its subtlety and transparency. Or else he is not
 speaking of all the angels; but only of such as sinned, who, in the
 opinion of some, belonged to the inferior orders. But there is
 nothing to hinder us from saying that the higher angels, as having an
 exalted and universal power over all corporeal things, were created
 in the highest place of the corporeal creature; while the other
 angels, as having more restricted powers, were created among the
 inferior bodies.
"," Isaias is not speaking there of any corporeal heaven,
 but of the heaven of the Blessed Trinity; unto which the sinning
 angel wished to ascend, when he desired to be equal in some manner
 to God, as will appear later on (Q. 63, A. 3).
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
310,"[I, Q. 62, Art. 1]
","Whether the Angels Were Created in Beatitude?
"," It would seem that the angels were created in beatitude.
 For it is stated (De Eccl. Dogm. xxix) that ""the angels who continue
 in the beatitude wherein they were created, do not of their nature
 possess the excellence they have."" Therefore the angels were created
 in beatitude.
"," Further, the angelic nature is nobler than the corporeal
 creature. But the corporeal creature straightway from its creation
 was made perfect and complete; nor did its lack of form take
 precedence in time, but only in nature, as Augustine says (Gen. ad
 lit. i, 15). Therefore neither did God create the angelic nature
 imperfect and incomplete. But its formation and perfection are
 derived from its beatitude, whereby it enjoys God. Therefore it was
 created in beatitude.
"," Further, according to Augustine (Gen. ad lit. iv, 34; v, 5),
 the things which we read of as being made in the works of the six
 days, were made together at one time; and so all the six days must
 have existed instantly from the beginning of creation. But, according
 to his exposition, in those six days, ""the morning"" was the angelic
 knowledge, according to which they knew the Word and things in the
 Word. Therefore straightway from their creation they knew the Word,
 and things in the Word. But the bliss of the angels comes of seeing
 the Word. Consequently the angels were in beatitude straightway from
 the very beginning of their creation.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Beatitude is there taken for that natural perfection
 which the angel had in the state of innocence.
"," The corporeal creature instantly in the beginning of
 its creation could not have the perfection to which it is brought by
 its operation; consequently, according to Augustine (Gen. ad. lit. v,
 4, 23; viii, 3), the growing of plants from the earth did not take
 place at once among the first works, in which only the germinating
 power of the plants was bestowed upon the earth. In the same way, the
 angelic creature in the beginning of its existence had the perfection
 of its nature; but it did not have the perfection to which it had to
 come by its operation.
"," The angel has a twofold knowledge of the Word; the one
 which is natural, and the other according to glory. He has a natural
 knowledge whereby he knows the Word through a similitude thereof
 shining in his nature; and he has a knowledge of glory whereby he
 knows the Word through His essence. By both kinds of knowledge the
 angel knows things in the Word; imperfectly by his natural knowledge,
 and perfectly by his knowledge of glory. Therefore the first
 knowledge of things in the Word was present to the angel from the
 outset of his creation; while the second was not, but only when the
 angels became blessed by turning to the good. And this is properly
 termed their morning knowledge.

311,"[I, Q. 62, Art. 2]
","Whether an Angel Needs Grace in Order to Turn to God?
"," It would seem that the angel had no need of grace in
 order to turn to God. For, we have no need of grace for what we can
 accomplish naturally. But the angel naturally turns to God: because
 he loves God naturally, as is clear from what has been said (Q. 60,
 A. 5). Therefore an angel did not need grace in order to turn to God.
"," Further, seemingly we need help only for difficult tasks. Now
 it was not a difficult task for the angel to turn to God; because
 there was no obstacle in him to such turning. Therefore the angel had
 no need of grace in order to turn to God.
"," Further, to turn oneself to God is to dispose oneself for
 grace; hence it is said (Zech. 1:3): ""Turn ye to Me, and I will turn
 to you."" But we do not stand in need of grace in order to prepare
 ourselves for grace: for thus we should go on to infinity. Therefore
 the angel did not need grace to turn to God.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The angel loves God naturally, so far as God is the
 author of his natural being. But here we are speaking of turning to
 God, so far as God bestows beatitude by the vision of His essence.
"," A thing is ""difficult"" which is beyond a power; and
 this happens in two ways. First of all, because it is beyond the
 natural capacity of the power. Thus, if it can be attained by some
 help, it is said to be ""difficult""; but if it can in no way be
 attained, then it is ""impossible""; thus it is impossible for a man to
 fly. In another way a thing may be beyond the power, not according to
 the natural order of such power, but owing to some intervening
 hindrance; as to mount upwards is not contrary to the natural order
 of the motive power of the soul; because the soul, considered in
 itself, can be moved in any direction; but is hindered from so doing
 by the weight of the body; consequently it is difficult for a man to
 mount upwards. To be turned to his ultimate beatitude is difficult
 for man, both because it is beyond his nature, and because he has a
 hindrance from the corruption of the body and infection of sin. But
 it is difficult for an angel, only because it is supernatural.
"," Every movement of the will towards God can be termed a
 conversion to God. And so there is a threefold turning to God. The
 first is by the perfect love of God; this belongs to the creature
 enjoying the possession of God; and for such conversion, consummate
 grace is required. The next turning to God is that which merits
 beatitude; and for this there is required habitual grace, which is
 the principle of merit. The third conversion is that whereby a man
 disposes himself so that he may have grace; for this no habitual
 grace is required; but the operation of God, Who draws the soul
 towards Himself, according to Lament. 5:21: ""Convert us, O Lord, to
 Thee, and we shall be converted."" Hence it is clear that there is no
 need to go on to infinity.

312,"[I, Q. 62, Art. 3]
","Whether the Angels Were Created in Grace?
"," It would seem that the angels were not created in grace.
 For Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. ii, 8) that the angelic nature was
 first made without form, and was called ""heaven"": but afterwards it
 received its form, and was then called ""light."" But such formation
 comes from grace. Therefore they were not created in grace.
"," Further, grace turns the rational creature towards God. If,
 therefore, the angel had been created in grace, no angel would ever
 have turned away from God.
"," Further, grace comes midway between nature and glory. But the
 angels were not beatified in their creation. Therefore it seems that
 they were not created in grace; but that they were first created in
 nature only, and then received grace, and that last of all they were
 beatified.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Such absence of form in the angels can be understood
 either by comparison with their formation in glory; and so the
 absence of formation preceded formation by priority of time. Or else
 it can be understood of the formation according to grace: and so it
 did not precede in the order of time, but in the order of nature; as
 Augustine holds with regard to the formation of corporeal things
 (Gen. ad lit. i, 15).
"," Every form inclines the subject after the mode of the
 subject's nature. Now it is the mode of an intellectual nature to be
 inclined freely towards the objects it desires. Consequently the
 movement of grace does not impose necessity; but he who has grace
 can fail to make use of it, and can sin.
"," Although in the order of nature grace comes midway
 between nature and glory, nevertheless, in the order of time, in
 created nature, glory is not simultaneous with nature; because glory
 is the end of the operation of nature helped by grace. But grace
 stands not as the end of operation, because it is not of works, but
 as the principle of right operation. Therefore it was fitting for
 grace to be given straightway with nature.

","Whether an Angel Merits His Beatitude?
"," It would seem that the angel did not merit his beatitude.
 For merit arises from the difficulty of the meritorious act. But the
 angel experienced no difficulty in acting rightly. Therefore righteous
 action was not meritorious for him.
"," Further, we do not merit by merely natural operations. But it
 was quite natural for the angel to turn to God. Therefore he did not
 thereby merit beatitude.
"," Further, if a beatified angel merited his beatitude, he did
 so either before he had it, or else afterwards. But it was not
 before; because, in the opinion of many, he had no grace before
 whereby to merit it. Nor did he merit it afterwards, because thus he
 would be meriting it now; which is clearly false, because in that
 case a lower angel could by meriting rise up to the rank of a higher,
 and the distinct degrees of grace would not be permanent; which is
 not admissible. Consequently the angel did not merit his beatitude.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The angel's difficulty of working righteously does not
 come from any contrariety or hindrance of natural powers; but from
 the fact that the good work is beyond his natural capacity.
"," An angel did not merit beatitude by natural movement
 towards God; but by the movement of charity, which comes of grace.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
314,"[I, Q. 62, Art. 5]
","Whether the Angel Obtained Beatitude Immediately After One Act of
"," It would seem that the angel did not possess beatitude
 instantly after one act of merit. For it is more difficult for a man
 to do well than for an angel. But man is not rewarded at once after
 one act of merit. Therefore neither was the angel.
"," Further, an angel could act at once, and in an instant, from
 the very outset of his creation, for even natural bodies begin to be
 moved in the very instant of their creation; and if the movement of a
 body could be instantaneous, like operations of mind and will, it
 would have movement in the first instant of its generation.
 Consequently, if the angel merited beatitude by one act of his will,
 he merited it in the first instant of his creation; and so, if their
 beatitude was not retarded, then the angels were in beatitude in the
 first instant.
"," Further, there must be many intervals between things which
 are far apart. But the beatific state of the angels is very far
 remote from their natural condition: while merit comes midway
 between. Therefore the angel would have to pass through many stages
 of merit in order to reach beatitude.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Man was not intended to secure his ultimate perfection
 at once, like the angel. Hence a longer way was assigned to man than
 to the angel for securing beatitude.
"," The angel is above the time of corporeal things; hence
 the various instants regarding the angels are not to be taken except
 as reckoning the succession of their acts. Now their act which
 merited beatitude could not be in them simultaneously with the act of
 beatitude, which is fruition; since the one belongs to imperfect
 grace, and the other to consummate grace. Consequently, it remains
 for different instants to be conceived, in one of which the angel
 merited beatitude, and in another was beatified.
"," It is of the nature of an angel instantly to attain
 the perfection unto which he is ordained. Consequently, only one
 meritorious act is required; which act can so far be called an
 interval as through it the angel is brought to beatitude.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
315,"[I, Q. 62, Art. 6]
","Whether the Angels Receive Grace and Glory According to the Degree of
"," It would seem that the angels did not receive grace and
 glory according to the degree of their natural gifts. For grace is
 bestowed of God's absolute will. Therefore the degree of grace
 depends on God's will, and not on the degree of their natural gifts.
"," Further, a moral act seems to be more closely allied with
 grace than nature is; because a moral act is preparatory to grace.
 But grace does not come ""of works,"" as is said Rom. 11:6. Therefore
 much less does the degree of grace depend upon the degree of their
 natural gifts.
"," Further, man and angel are alike ordained for beatitude or
 grace. But man does not receive more grace according to the degree of
 his natural gifts. Therefore neither does the angel.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," As grace comes of God's will alone, so likewise does
 the nature of the angel: and as God's will ordained nature for grace,
 so did it ordain the various degrees of nature to the various degrees
 of grace.
"," The acts of the rational creature are from the creature
 itself; whereas nature is immediately from God. Accordingly it seems
 rather that grace is bestowed according to degree of nature than
 according to works.
"," Diversity of natural gifts is in one way in the angels,
 who are themselves different specifically; and in quite another way
 in men, who differ only numerically. For specific difference is on
 account of the end; while numerical difference is because of the
 matter. Furthermore, there is something in man which can thwart or
 impede the movement of his intellective nature; but not in the
 angels. Consequently the argument is not the same for both.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
316,"[I, Q. 62, Art. 7]
","Whether Natural Knowledge and Love Remain in the Beatified Angels?
"," It would seem that natural knowledge and love do not
 remain in the beatified angels. For it is said (1 Cor. 13:10): ""When
 that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be
 done away."" But natural love and knowledge are imperfect in comparison
 with beatified knowledge and love. Therefore, in beatitude, natural
 knowledge and love cease.
"," Further, where one suffices, another is superfluous. But the
 knowledge and love of glory suffice for the beatified angels.
 Therefore it would be superfluous for their natural knowledge and
 love to remain.
"," Further, the same faculty has not two simultaneous acts, as
 the same line cannot, at the same end, be terminated in two points.
 But the beatified angels are always exercising their beatified
 knowledge and love; for, as is said Ethic. i, 8, happiness consists
 not in habit, but in act. Therefore there can never be natural
 knowledge and love in the angels.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The advent of a perfection removes the opposite
 imperfection. Now the imperfection of nature is not opposed to the
 perfection of beatitude, but underlies it; as the imperfection of the
 power underlies the perfection of the form, and the power is not taken
 away by the form, but the privation which is opposed to the form. In
 the same way, the imperfection of natural knowledge is not opposed to
 the perfection of the knowledge in glory; for nothing hinders us from
 knowing a thing through various mediums, as a thing may be known at
 the one time through a probable medium and through a demonstrative
 one. In like manner, an angel can know God by His essence, and this
 appertains to his knowledge of glory; and at the same time he can know
 God by his own essence, which belongs to his natural knowledge.
"," All things which make up beatitude are sufficient of
 themselves. But in order for them to exist, they presuppose the
 natural gifts; because no beatitude is self-subsisting, except the
 uncreated beatitude.
"," There cannot be two operations of the one faculty at
 the one time, except the one be ordained to the other. But natural
 knowledge and love are ordained to the knowledge and love of glory.
 Accordingly there is nothing to hinder natural knowledge and love
 from existing in the angel conjointly with those of glory.

317,"[I, Q. 62, Art. 8]
","Whether a Beatified Angel Can Sin?
"," It would seem that a beatified angel can sin. For, as
 as said above (A. 7), beatitude does not do away with nature. But it
 is of the very notion of created nature, that it can fail. Therefore
 a beatified angel can sin.
"," Further, the rational powers are referred to opposites, as
 the Philosopher observes (Metaph. iv, text. 3). But the will of the
 angel in beatitude does not cease to be rational. Therefore it is
 inclined towards good and evil.
"," Further, it belongs to the liberty of free-will for man to be
 able to choose good or evil. But the freedom of will is not lessened
 in the beatified angels. Therefore they can sin.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Created good, considered in itself, can fail.
 But from its perfect union with the uncreated good, such as is the
 union of beatitude, it is rendered unable to sin, for the reason
 already alleged.
"," The rational powers are referred to opposites in
 the things to which they are not inclined naturally; but as to the
 things whereunto they have a natural tendency, they are not referred
 to opposites. For the intellect cannot but assent to naturally known
 principles; in the same way, the will cannot help clinging to good,
 formally as good; because the will is naturally ordained to good as to
 its proper object. Consequently the will of the angels is referred to
 opposites, as to doing many things, or not doing them. But they have
 no tendency to opposites with regard to God Himself, Whom they see to
 be the very nature of goodness; but in all things their aim is towards
 God, which ever alternative they choose, that is not sinful.
"," Free-will in its choice of means to an end is
 disposed just as the intellect is to conclusions. Now it is evident
 that it belongs to the power of the intellect to be able to proceed to
 different conclusions, according to given principles; but for it to
 proceed to some conclusion by passing out of the order of the
 principles, comes of its own defect. Hence it belongs to the
 perfection of its liberty for the free-will to be able to choose
 between opposite things, keeping the order of the end in view; but it
 comes of the defect of liberty for it to choose anything by turning
 away from the order of the end; and this is to sin. Hence there is
 greater liberty of will in the angels, who cannot sin, than there is
 in ourselves, who can sin.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
318,"[I, Q. 62, Art. 3]
","Whether the Beatified Angels Advance in Beatitude?
"," It would seem that the beatified angels can advance in
 beatitude. For charity is the principle of merit. But there is
 perfect charity in the angels. Therefore the beatified angels can
 merit. Now, as merit increases, the reward of beatitude increases.
 Therefore the beatified angels can progress in beatitude.
"," Further, Augustine says (De Doctr. Christ. i) that ""God
 makes use of us for our own gain, and for His own goodness. The same
 thing happens to the angels, whom He uses for spiritual
 ministrations""; since ""they are all [*Vulg.: 'Are they not
 all . . . ?'] ministering spirits, sent to minister for them who
 shall receive the inheritance of salvation"" (Heb. 1:14). This would
 not be for their profit were they not to merit thereby, nor to
 advance to beatitude. It remains, then, that the beatified angels
 can merit, and can advance in beatitude.
"," Further, it argues imperfection for anyone not occupying
 the foremost place not to be able to advance. But the angels are not
 in the highest degree of beatitude. Therefore if unable to ascend
 higher, it would appear that there is imperfection and defect in
 them; which is not admissible.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Merit belongs to a subject which is moving towards its
 end. Now the rational creature is moved towards its end, not merely
 passively, but also by working actively. If the end is within the
 power of the rational creature, then its action is said to procure
 the end; as man acquires knowledge by reflection: but if the end be
 beyond its power, and is looked for from another, then the action
 will be meritorious of such end. But what is already in the ultimate
 term is not said to be moved, but to have been moved. Consequently,
 to merit belongs to the imperfect charity of this life; whereas
 perfect charity does not merit but rather enjoys the reward. Even as
 in acquired habits, the operation preceding the habit is productive
 of the habit; but the operation from an acquired habit is both
 perfect and enjoyable. In the same way the act of perfect charity has
 no quality of merit, but belongs rather to the perfection of the
 reward.
"," A thing can be termed useful in two ways. First of all,
 as being on the way to an end; and so the merit of beatitude is
 useful. Secondly, as the part is useful for the whole; as the wall
 for a house. In this way the angelic ministerings are useful for the
 beatified angels, inasmuch as they are a part of their beatitude; for
 to pour out acquired perfection upon others is of the nature of what
 is perfect, considered as perfect.
"," Although a beatified angel is not absolutely in the
 highest degree of beatitude, yet, in his own regard he is in the
 highest degree, according to Divine predestination. Nevertheless the
 joy of the angels can be increased with regard to the salvation of
 such as are saved by their ministrations, according to Luke 15:10:
 ""There is [Vulg.'shall be'] joy before the angels of God upon one
 sinner doing penance."" Such joy belongs to their accidental reward,
 which can be increased unto judgment day. Hence some writers say that
 they can merit as to their accidental reward. But it is better to say
 that the Blessed can in no wise merit without being at the same time
 a wayfarer and a comprehensor; like Christ, Who alone was such. For
 the Blessed acquire such joy from the virtue of their beatitude,
 rather than merit it.

","Whether the Evil of Fault Can Be in the Angels?
"," It would seem that there can be no evil of fault in the
 angels. For there can be no evil except in things which are in
 potentiality, as is said by the Philosopher (Metaph. ix, text. 19),
 because the subject of privation is a being in potentiality. But the
 angels have not being in potentiality, since they are subsisting
 forms. Therefore there can be no evil in them.
"," Further, the angels are higher than the heavenly bodies. But
 philosophers say that there cannot be evil in the heavenly bodies.
 Therefore neither can there be in the angels.
"," Further, what is natural to a thing is always in it. But it
 is natural for the angels to be moved by the movement of love towards
 God. Therefore such love cannot be withdrawn from them. But in loving
 God they do not sin. Consequently the angels cannot sin.
"," Further, desire is only of what is good or apparently good.
 Now for the angels there can be no apparent good which is not a true
 good; because in them either there can be no error at all, or at
 least not before guilt. Therefore the angels can desire only what it
 truly good. But no one sins by desiring what is truly good.
 Consequently the angel does not sin by desire.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," In the angels there is no potentiality to natural
 existence. Yet there is potentiality in their intellective part, as
 regards their being inclined to this or the other object. In this
 respect there can be evil in them.
"," The heavenly bodies have none but a natural operation.
 Therefore as there can be no evil of corruption in their nature; so
 neither can there be evil of disorder in their natural action. But
 besides their natural action there is the action of free-will in the
 angels, by reason of which evil may be in them.
"," It is natural for the angel to turn to God by the
 movement of love, according as God is the principle of his natural
 being. But for him to turn to God as the object of supernatural
 beatitude, comes of infused love, from which he could be turned away
 by sinning.
"," Mortal sin occurs in two ways in the act of free-will.
 First, when something evil is chosen; as man sins by choosing
 adultery, which is evil of itself. Such sin always comes of ignorance
 or error; otherwise what is evil would never be chosen as good. The
 adulterer errs in the particular, choosing this delight of an
 inordinate act as something good to be performed now, from the
 inclination of passion or of habit; even though he does not err in
 his universal judgment, but retains a right opinion in this respect.
 In this way there can be no sin in the angel; because there are no
 passions in the angels to fetter reason or intellect, as is manifest
 from what has been said above (Q. 59, A. 4); nor, again, could any
 habit inclining to sin precede their first sin. In another way sin
 comes of free-will by choosing something good in itself, but not
 according to proper measure or rule; so that the defect which induces
 sin is only on the part of the choice which is not properly
 regulated, but not on the part of the thing chosen; as if one were to
 pray, without heeding the order established by the Church. Such a sin
 does not presuppose ignorance, but merely absence of consideration of
 the things which ought to be considered. In this way the angel
 sinned, by seeking his own good, from his own free-will,
 insubordinately to the rule of the Divine will.

","Whether Only the Sin of Pride and Envy Can Exist in an Angel?
"," It would seem that there can be other sins in the angels
 besides those of pride and envy. Because whosoever can delight in any
 kind of sin, can fall into the sin itself. But the demons delight even
 in the obscenities of carnal sins; as Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xiv,
 3). Therefore there can also be carnal sins in the demons.
"," Further, as pride and envy are spiritual sins, so are sloth,
 avarice, and anger. But spiritual sins are concerned with the spirit,
 just as carnal sins are with the flesh. Therefore not only can there
 be pride and envy in the angels; but likewise sloth and avarice.
"," Further, according to Gregory (Moral. xxxi), many vices
 spring from pride; and in like manner from envy. But, if the cause is
 granted, the effect follows. If, therefore, there can be pride and
 envy in the angels, for the same reason there can likewise be other
 vices in them.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The demons do not delight in the obscenities of the
 sins of the flesh, as if they themselves were disposed to carnal
 pleasures: it is wholly through envy that they take pleasure in all
 sorts of human sins, so far as these are hindrances to a man's good.
"," Avarice, considered as a special kind of sin, is the
 immoderate greed of temporal possessions which serve the use of human
 life, and which can be estimated in value of money; to these demons
 are not at all inclined, any more than they are to carnal pleasures.
 Consequently avarice properly so called cannot be in them. But if
 every immoderate greed of possessing any created good be termed
 avarice, in this way avarice is contained under the pride which is in
 the demons. Anger implies passion, and so does concupiscence;
 consequently they can only exist metaphorically in the demons. Sloth
 is a kind of sadness, whereby a man becomes sluggish in spiritual
 exercises because they weary the body; which does not apply to the
 demons. So it is evident that pride and envy are the only spiritual
 sins which can be found in demons; yet so that envy is not to be
 taken for a passion, but for a will resisting the good of another.
"," Under envy and pride, as found in the demons, are
 comprised all other sins derived from them.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
321,"[I, Q. 63, Art. 3]
","Whether the Devil Desired to Be As God?
"," It would seem that the devil did not desire to be as
 God. For what does not fall under apprehension, does not fall under
 desire; because the good which is apprehended moves the appetite,
 whether sensible, rational, or intellectual; and sin consists only
 in such desire. But for any creature to be God's equal does not fall
 under apprehension, because it implies a contradiction; for it the
 finite equals the infinite, then it would itself be infinite.
 Therefore an angel could not desire to be as God.
"," Further, the natural end can always be desired without sin.
 But to be likened unto God is the end to which every creature
 naturally tends. If, therefore, the angel desired to be as God, not
 by equality, but by likeness, it would seem that he did not thereby
 sin.
"," Further, the angel was created with greater fulness of wisdom
 than man. But no man, save a fool, ever makes choice of being the
 equal of an angel, still less of God; because choice regards only
 things which are possible, regarding which one takes deliberation.
 Therefore much less did the angel sin by desiring to be as God.

322,"[I, Q. 63, Art. 4]
","Whether Any Demons Are Naturally Wicked?
"," It would seem that some demons are naturally wicked. For
 Porphyry says, as quoted by Augustine (De Civ. Dei x, 11): ""There is
 a class of demons of crafty nature, pretending that they are gods and
 the souls of the dead."" But to be deceitful is to be evil. Therefore
 some demons are naturally wicked.
"," Further, as the angels are created by God, so are men.
 But some men are naturally wicked, of whom it is said (Wis. 12:10):
 ""Their malice is natural."" Therefore some angels may be naturally
 wicked.
"," Further, some irrational animals have wicked dispositions
 by nature: thus the fox is naturally sly, and the wolf naturally
 rapacious; yet they are God's creatures. Therefore, although the
 demons are God's creatures, they may be naturally wicked.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Augustine rebukes Porphyry for saying that the demons
 are naturally deceitful; himself maintaining that they are not
 naturally so, but of their own will. Now the reason why Porphyry held
 that they are naturally deceitful was that, as he contended, demons
 are animals with a sensitive nature. Now the sensitive nature is
 inclined towards some particular good, with which evil may be
 connected. In this way, then, it can have a natural inclination to
 evil; yet only accidentally, inasmuch as evil is connected with good.
"," The malice of some men can be called natural, either
 because of custom which is a second nature; or on account of the
 natural proclivity on the part of the sensitive nature to some
 inordinate passion, as some people are said to be naturally wrathful
 or lustful; but not on the part of the intellectual nature.
"," Brute beasts have a natural inclination in their
 sensitive nature towards certain particular goods, with which certain
 evils are connected; thus the fox in seeking its food has a natural
 inclination to do so with a certain skill coupled with deceit.
 Wherefore it is not evil in the fox to be sly, since it is natural to
 him; as it is not evil in the dog to be fierce, as Dionysius observes
 (De Div. Nom. iv).

323,"[I, Q. 63, Art. 5]
","Whether the Devil Was Wicked by the Fault of His Own Will in the
"," It would seem that the devil was wicked by the fault of
 his own will in the first instant of his creation. For it is said of
 the devil (John 8:44): ""He was a murderer from the beginning.""
"," Further, according to Augustine (Gen. ad lit. i, 15), the
 lack of form in the creature did not precede its formation in order
 of time, but merely in order of nature. Now according to him (Gen. ad
 lit. ii, 8), the ""heaven,"" which is said to have been created in the
 beginning, signifies the angelic nature while as yet not fully formed:
 and when it is said that God said: ""Be light made: and light was
 made,"" we are to understand the full formation of the angel by turning
 to the Word. Consequently, the nature of the angel was created, and
 light was made, in the one instant. But at the same moment that light
 was made, it was made distinct from ""darkness,"" whereby the angels who
 sinned are denoted. Therefore in the first instant of their creation
 some of the angels were made blessed, and some sinned.
"," Further, sin is opposed to merit. But some intellectual
 nature can merit in the first instant of its creation; as the soul of
 Christ, or also the good angels. Therefore the demons likewise could
 sin in the first instant of their creation.
"," Further, the angelic nature is more powerful than the
 corporeal nature. But a corporeal thing begins to have its operation
 in the first instant of its creation; as fire begins to move upwards
 in the first instant it is produced. Therefore the angel could also
 have his operation in the first instant of his creation. Now this
 operation was either ordinate or inordinate. If ordinate, then, since
 he had grace, he thereby merited beatitude. But with the angels the
 reward follows immediately upon merit; as was said above (Q. 62, A.
 5). Consequently they would have become blessed at once; and so would
 never have sinned, which is false. It remains, then, that they sinned
 by inordinate action in their first instant.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," As Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xi, 15), when it is
 stated that ""the devil sins from the beginning,"" ""he is not to be
 thought of as sinning from the beginning wherein he was created, but
 from the beginning of sin"": that is to say, because he never went
 back from his sin.
"," That distinction of light and darkness, whereby the
 sins of the demons are understood by the term darkness, must be taken
 as according to God's foreknowledge. Hence Augustine says (De Civ.
 Dei xi, 15), that ""He alone could discern light and darkness, Who
 also could foreknow, before they fell, those who would fall.""
"," All that is in merit is from God; and consequently an
 angel could merit in the first instant of his creation. The same
 reason does not hold good of sin; as has been said.
"," God did not distinguish between the angels before the
 turning away of some of them, and the turning of others to Himself,
 as Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xi, 15). Therefore, as all were
 created in grace, all merited in their first instant. But some of
 them at once placed an impediment to their beatitude, thereby
 destroying their preceding merit; and consequently they were
 deprived of the beatitude which they had merited.
",,,,,,,,,,,,
324,"[I, Q. 63, Art. 6]
","Whether There Was Any Interval Between the Creation and the Fall of
"," It would seem that there was some interval between the
 angel's creation and his fall. For, it is said (Ezech. 28:15): ""Thou
 didst walk perfect [*Vulg.: 'Thou hast walked in the midst of the
 stones of fire; thou wast perfect . . .'] in thy ways from the day of
 thy creation until iniquity was found in thee."" But since walking is
 continuous movement, it requires an interval. Therefore there was some
 interval between the devil's creation and his fall.
"," Further, Origen says (Hom. i in Ezech.) that ""the serpent
 of old did not from the first walk upon his breast and belly""; which
 refers to his sin. Therefore the devil did not sin at once after the
 first instant of his creation.
"," Further, capability of sinning is common alike to man and
 angel. But there was some delay between man's formation and his sin.
 Therefore, for the like reason there was some interval between the
 devil's formation and his sin.
"," Further, the instant wherein the devil sinned was
 distinct from the instant wherein he was created. But there is a
 middle time between every two instants. Therefore there was an
 interval between his creation and his fall.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," Sometimes in Holy Scripture spiritual instantaneous
 movements are represented by corporeal movements which are measured
 by time. In this way by ""walking"" we are to understand the movement
 of free-will tending towards good.
"," Origen says, ""The serpent of old did not from the first
 walk upon his breast and belly,"" because of the first instant in
 which he was not wicked.
"," An angel has an inflexible free-will after once
 choosing; consequently, if after the first instant, in which he had a
 natural movement to good, he had not at once placed a barrier to
 beatitude, he would have been confirmed in good. It is not so with
 man; and therefore the argument does not hold good.
"," It is true to say that there is a middle time between
 every two instants, so far as time is continuous, as it is proved
 Phys. vi, text. 2. But in the angels, who are not subject to the
 heavenly movement, which is primarily measured by continuous time,
 time is taken to mean the succession of their mental acts, or of
 their affections. So the first instant in the angels is understood to
 respond to the operation of the angelic mind, whereby it introspects
 itself by its evening knowledge because on the first day evening is
 mentioned, but not morning. This operation was good in them all. From
 such operation some of them were converted to the praise of the Word
 by their morning knowledge while others, absorbed in themselves,
 became night, ""swelling up with pride,"" as Augustine says (Gen. ad
 lit. iv, 24). Hence the first act was common to them all; but in
 their second they were separated. Consequently they were all of them
 good in the first instant; but in the second the good were set apart
 from the wicked.
",,,,,,,,,,,,
325,"[I, Q. 63, Art. 7]
","Whether the Highest Angel Among Those Who Sinned Was the Highest of
"," It would seem that the highest among the angels who
 sinned was not the highest of all. For it is stated (Ezech. 28:14):
 ""Thou wast a cherub stretched out, and protecting, and I set thee in
 the holy mountain of God."" Now the order of the Cherubim is under
 the order of the Seraphim, as Dionysius says (Coel. Hier. vi, vii).
 Therefore, the highest angel among those who sinned was not the
 highest of all.
"," Further, God made intellectual nature in order that it
 might attain to beatitude. If therefore the highest of the angels
 sinned, it follows that the Divine ordinance was frustrated in the
 noblest creature which is unfitting.
"," Further, the more a subject is inclined towards anything, so
 much the less can it fall away from it. But the higher an angel is,
 so much the more is he inclined towards God. Therefore so much the
 less can he turn away from God by sinning. And so it seems that the
 angel who sinned was not the highest of all, but one of the lower
 angels.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Cherubim is interpreted ""fulness of knowledge,"" while
 ""Seraphim"" means ""those who are on fire,"" or ""who set on fire.""
 Consequently Cherubim is derived from knowledge; which is compatible
 with mortal sin; but Seraphim is derived from the heat of charity,
 which is incompatible with mortal sin. Therefore the first angel who
 sinned is called, not a Seraph, but a Cherub.
"," The Divine intention is not frustrated either in those
 who sin, or in those who are saved; for God knows beforehand the end
 of both; and He procures glory from both, saving these of His
 goodness, and punishing those of His justice. But the intellectual
 creature, when it sins, falls away from its due end. Nor is this
 unfitting in any exalted creature; because the intellectual creature
 was so made by God, that it lies within its own will to act for its
 end.
"," However great was the inclination towards good in the
 highest angel, there was no necessity imposed upon him: consequently
 it was in his power not to follow it.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
326,"[I, Q. 63, Art. 8]
","Whether the Sin of the Highest Angel Was the Cause of the Others
"," It would seem that the sin of the highest angel was not
 the cause of the others sinning. For the cause precedes the effect.
 But, as Damascene observes (De Fide Orth. ii), they all sinned at
 one time. Therefore the sin of one was not the cause of the others'
 sinning.
"," Further, an angel's first sin can only be pride, as was
 shown above (A. 2). But pride seeks excellence. Now it is more
 contrary to excellence for anyone to be subject to an inferior than
 to a superior; and so it does not appear that the angels sinned by
 desiring to be subject to a higher angel rather than to God. Yet the
 sin of one angel would have been the cause of the others sinning, if
 he had induced them to be his subjects. Therefore it does not appear
 that the sin of the highest angel was the cause of the others sinning.
"," Further, it is a greater sin to wish to be subject to
 another against God, than to wish to be over another against God;
 because there is less motive for sinning. If, therefore, the sin of
 the foremost angel was the cause of the others sinning, in that he
 induced them to subject themselves to him, then the lower angels would
 have sinned more deeply than the highest one; which is contrary to a
 gloss on Ps. 103:26: ""This dragon which Thou hast formed--He who was
 the more excellent than the rest in nature, became the greater in
 malice."" Therefore the sin of the highest angel was not the cause of
 the others sinning.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Although the demons all sinned in the one instant, yet
 the sin of one could be the cause of the rest sinning. For the angel
 needs no delay of time for choice, exhortation, or consent, as man,
 who requires deliberation in order to choose and consent, and vocal
 speech in order to exhort; both of which are the work of time. And it
 is evident that even man begins to speak in the very instant when he
 takes thought; and in the last instant of speech, another who catches
 his meaning can assent to what is said; as is especially evident with
 regard to primary concepts, ""which everyone accepts directly they are
 heard"" [*Boethius, De Hebdom.].
"," Other things being equal, the proud would rather be
 subject to a superior than to an inferior. Yet he chooses rather to
 be subject to an inferior than to a superior, if he can procure an
 advantage under an inferior which he cannot under a superior.
 Consequently it was not against the demons' pride for them to wish to
 serve an inferior by yielding to his rule; for they wanted to have
 him as their prince and leader, so that they might attain their
 ultimate beatitude of their own natural powers; especially because in
 the order of nature they were even then subject to the highest angel.
"," As was observed above (Q. 62, A. 6), an angel has
 nothing in him to retard his action, and with his whole might he is
 moved to whatsoever he is moved, be it good or bad. Consequently
 since the highest angel had greater natural energy than the lower
 angels, he fell into sin with intenser energy, and therefore he
 became the greater in malice.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
327,"[I, Q. 63, Art. 9]
","Whether Those Who Sinned Were As Many As Those Who Remained Firm?
"," It would seem that more angels sinned than stood firm.
 For, as the Philosopher says (Ethic. ii, 6): ""Evil is in many, but
 good is in few.""
"," Further, justice and sin are to be found in the same way
 in men and in angels. But there are more wicked men to be found than
 good; according to Eccles. 1:15: ""The number of fools is infinite.""
 Therefore for the same reason it is so with the angels.
"," Further, the angels are distinguished according to
 persons and orders. Therefore if more angelic persons stood firm, it
 would appear that those who sinned were not from all the orders.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The Philosopher is speaking with regard to men, in whom
 evil comes to pass from seeking after sensible pleasures, which are
 known to most men, and from forsaking the good dictated by reason,
 which good is known to the few. In the angels there is only an
 intellectual nature; hence the argument does not hold.
"," According to those who hold that the chief devil
 belonged to the lower order of the angels, who are set over earthly
 affairs, it is evident that some of every order did not fall, but
 only those of the lowest order. According to those who maintain that
 the chief devil was of the highest order, it is probable that some
 fell of every order; just as men are taken up into every order to
 supply for the angelic ruin. In this view the liberty of free-will is
 more established; which in every degree of creature can be turned to
 evil. In the Sacred Scripture, however, the names of some orders, as
 of Seraphim and Thrones, are not attributed to demons; since they are
 derived from the ardor of love and from God's indwelling, which are
 not consistent with mortal sin. Yet the names of Cherubim, Powers,
 and Principalities are attributed to them; because these names are
 derived from knowledge and from power, which can be common to both
 good and bad.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
328,"[I, Q. 64, Art. 1]
","Whether the Demons' Intellect Is Darkened by Privation of the
"," It would seem that the demons' intellect is darkened by
 being deprived of the knowledge of all truth. For if they knew any
 truth at all, they would most of all know themselves; which is to
 know separated substances. But this is not in keeping with their
 unhappiness: for this seems to belong to great happiness, insomuch as
 that some writers have assigned as man's last happiness the knowledge
 of the separated substances. Therefore the demons are deprived of all
 knowledge of truth.
"," Further, what is most manifest in its nature, seems to be
 specially manifest to the angels, whether good or bad. That the same
 is not manifest with regard to ourselves, comes from the weakness of
 our intellect which draws its knowledge from phantasms; as it comes
 from the weakness of its eye that the owl cannot behold the light of
 the sun. But the demons cannot know God, Who is most manifest of
 Himself, because He is the sovereign truth; and this is because they
 are not clean of heart, whereby alone can God be seen. Therefore
 neither can they know other things.
"," Further, according to Augustine (Gen. ad lit. iv, 22), the
 proper knowledge of the angels is twofold; namely, morning and
 evening. But the demons have no morning knowledge, because they do
 not see things in the Word; nor have they the evening knowledge,
 because this evening knowledge refers the things known to the
 Creator's praise (hence, after ""evening"" comes ""morning"" [Gen. 1]).
 Therefore the demons can have no knowledge of things.
"," Further, the angels at their creation knew the mystery of the
 kingdom of God, as Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. v, 19; De Civ. Dei
 xi). But the demons are deprived of such knowledge: ""for if they had
 known it, they would never have crucified the Lord of glory,"" as is
 said 1 Cor. 2:8. Therefore, for the same reason, they are deprived of
 all other knowledge of truth.
"," Further, whatever truth anyone knows is known either
 naturally, as we know first principles; or by deriving it from
 someone else, as we know by learning; or by long experience, as the
 things we learn by discovery. Now, the demons cannot know the truth
 by their own nature, because, as Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xi, 33),
 the good angels are separated from them as light is from darkness;
 and every manifestation is made through light, as is said Eph. 5:13.
 In like manner they cannot learn by revelation, nor by learning from
 the good angels: because ""there is no fellowship of light with
 darkness [*Vulg.: 'What fellowship hath . . . ?']"" (2 Cor. 6:14). Nor
 can they learn by long experience: because experience comes of the
 senses. Consequently there is no knowledge of truth in them.
",,,,,,,,,,,,," Happiness consists in self-application to something
 higher. The separated substances are above us in the order of nature;
 hence man can have happiness of a kind by knowing the separated
 substances, although his perfect happiness consists in knowing the
 first substance, namely, God. But it is quite natural for one
 separate substance to know another; as it is natural for us to know
 sensible natures. Hence, as man's happiness does not consist in
 knowing sensible natures; so neither does the angel's happiness
 consist in knowing separated substances.
"," What is most manifest in its nature is hidden from us
 by its surpassing the bounds of our intellect; and not merely because
 our intellect draws knowledge from phantasms. Now the Divine
 substance surpasses the proportion not only of the human intellect,
 but even of the angelic. Consequently, not even an angel can of his
 own nature know God's substance. Yet on account of the perfection of
 his intellect he can of his nature have a higher knowledge of God
 than man can have. Such knowledge of God remains also in the demons.
 Although they do not possess the purity which comes with grace,
 nevertheless they have purity of nature; and this suffices for the
 knowledge of God which belongs to them from their nature.
"," The creature is darkness in comparison with the
 excellence of the Divine light; and therefore the creature's
 knowledge in its own nature is called ""evening"" knowledge. For the
 evening is akin to darkness, yet it possesses some light: but when
 the light fails utterly, then it is night. So then the knowledge of
 things in their own nature, when referred to the praise of the
 Creator, as it is in the good angels, has something of the Divine
 light, and can be called evening knowledge; but if it be not referred
 to God, as is the case with the demons, it is not called evening, but
 ""nocturnal"" knowledge. Accordingly we read in Gen. 1:5 that the
 darkness, which God separated from the light, ""He called night.""
"," All the angels had some knowledge from the very
 beginning respecting the mystery of God's kingdom, which found its
 completion in Christ; and most of all from the moment when they were
 beatified by the vision of the Word, which vision the demons never
 had. Yet all the angels did not fully and equally apprehend it; hence
 the demons much less fully understood the mystery of the Incarnation,
 when Christ was in the world. For, as Augustine observes (De Civ. Dei
 ix, 21), ""It was not manifested to them as it was to the holy angels,
 who enjoy a participated eternity of the Word; but it was made known
 by some temporal effects, so as to strike terror into them."" For had
 they fully and certainly known that He was the Son of God and the
 effect of His passion, they would never have procured the crucifixion
 of the Lord of glory.
"," The demons know a truth in three ways: first of all by
 the subtlety of their nature; for although they are darkened by
 privation of the light of grace, yet they are enlightened by the
 light of their intellectual nature: secondly, by revelation from the
 holy angels; for while not agreeing with them in conformity of will,
 they do agree, nevertheless, by their likeness of intellectual
 nature, according to which they can accept what is manifested by
 others: thirdly, they know by long experience; not as deriving it
 from the senses; but when the similitude of their innate intelligible
 species is completed in individual things, they know some things as
 present, which they previously did not know would come to pass, as we
 said when dealing with the knowledge of the angels (Q. 57, A. 3, ad
 3).
",,,,,,,,,,,
329,"[I, Q. 64, Art. 2]
","Whether the Will of the Demons Is Obstinate in Evil?
"," It would seem that the will of the demons is not
 obstinate in evil. For liberty of will belongs to the nature of an
 intellectual being, which nature remains in the demons, as we said
 above (A. 1). But liberty of will is directly and firstly ordained
 to good rather than to evil. Therefore the demons' will is not so
 obstinate in evil as not to be able to return to what is good.
"," Further, since God's mercy is infinite, it is greater than
 the demons' malice, which is finite. But no one returns from the
 malice of sin to the goodness of justice save through God's mercy.
 Therefore the demons can likewise return from their state of malice
 to the state of justice.
"," Further, if the demons have a will obstinate in evil, then
 their will would be especially obstinate in the sin whereby they
 fell. But that sin, namely, pride, is in them no longer; because the
 motive for the sin no longer endures, namely, excellence. Therefore
 the demon is not obstinate in malice.
"," Further, Gregory says (Moral. iv) that man can be reinstated
 by another, since he fell through another. But, as was observed
 already (Q. 63, A. 8), the lower demons fell through the highest one.
 Therefore their fall can be repaired by another. Consequently they
 are not obstinate in malice.
"," Further, whoever is obstinate in malice, never performs any
 good work. But the demon performs some good works: for he confesses
 the truth, saying to Christ: ""I know Who Thou art, the holy one of
 God"" (Mark 1:24). ""The demons"" also ""believe and tremble"" (James
 2:19). And Dionysius observes (Div. Nom. iv), that ""they desire what
 is good and best, which is, to be, to live, to understand."" Therefore
 they are not obstinate in malice.
",,,,,,,,,,,,," The good and wicked angels have free-will, but
 according to the manner and condition of their state, as has been
 said.
"," God's mercy delivers from sin those who repent. But
 such as are not capable of repenting, cling immovably to sin, and
 are not delivered by the Divine mercy.
"," The devil's first sin still remains in him according to
 desire; although not as to his believing that he can obtain what he
 desired. Even so, if a man were to believe that he can commit murder,
 and wills to commit it, and afterwards the power is taken from him;
 nevertheless, the will to murder can stay with him, so that he would
 he had done it, or still would do it if he could.
"," The fact that man sinned from another's suggestion, is
 not the whole cause of man's sin being pardonable. Consequently the
 argument does not hold good.
"," A demon's act is twofold. One comes of deliberate will;
 and this is properly called his own act. Such an act on the demon's
 part is always wicked; because, although at times he does something
 good, yet he does not do it well; as when he tells the truth in order
 to deceive; and when he believes and confesses, yet not willingly,
 but compelled by the evidence of things. Another kind of act is
 natural to the demon; this can be good and bears witness to the
 goodness of nature. Yet he abuses even such good acts to evil purpose.

","Whether There Is Sorrow in the Demons?
"," It would seem that there is no sorrow in the demons. For
 since sorrow and joy are opposites, they cannot be together in the
 same subject. But there is joy in the demons: for Augustine writing
 against the Maniches (De Gen. Contra Manich. ii, 17) says: ""The devil
 has power over them who despise God's commandments, and he rejoices
 over this sinister power."" Therefore there is no sorrow in the demons.
"," Further, sorrow is the cause of fear, for those things
 cause fear while they are future, which cause sorrow when they are
 present. But there is no fear in the demons, according to Job 41:24,
 ""Who was made to fear no one."" Therefore there is no grief in the
 demons.
"," Further, it is a good thing to be sorry for evil. But the
 demons can do no good action. Therefore they cannot be sorry, at least
 for the evil of sin; which applies to the worm of conscience.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Joy and sorrow about the same thing are opposites, but
 not about different things. Hence there is nothing to hinder a man
 from being sorry for one thing, and joyful for another; especially so
 far as sorrow and joy imply simple acts of the will; because, not
 merely in different things, but even in one and the same thing, there
 can be something that we will, and something that we will not.
"," As there is sorrow in the demons over present evil, so
 also there is fear of future evil. Now when it is said, ""He was made
 to fear no one,"" this is to be understood of the fear of God which
 restrains from sin. For it is written elsewhere that ""the devils
 believe and tremble"" (James 2:19).
"," To be sorry for the evil of sin on account of the sin
 bears witness to the goodness of the will, to which the evil of sin
 is opposed. But to be sorry for the evil of punishment, or for the
 evil of sin on account of the punishment, bears witness to the
 goodness of nature, to which the evil of punishment is opposed. Hence
 Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xix, 13), that ""sorrow for good lost by
 punishment, is the witness to a good nature."" Consequently, since the
 demon has a perverse and obstinate will, he is not sorry for the evil
 of sin.

331,"[I, Q. 64, Art. 4]
","Whether Our Atmosphere Is the Demons' Place of Punishment?
"," It would seem that this atmosphere is not the demons'
 place of punishment. For a demon is a spiritual nature. But a
 spiritual nature is not affected by place. Therefore there is no
 place of punishment for demons.
"," Further, man's sin is not graver than the demons'. But
 man's place of punishment is hell. Much more, therefore, is it the
 demons' place of punishment; and consequently not the darksome
 atmosphere.
"," Further, the demons are punished with the pain of fire.
 But there is no fire in the darksome atmosphere. Therefore the
 darksome atmosphere is not the place of punishment for the demons.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," A place is not penal to angel or soul as if affecting
 the nature by changing it, but as affecting the will by saddening it:
 because the angel or the soul apprehends that it is in a place not
 agreeable to its will.
"," One soul is not set over another in the order of
 nature, as the demons are over men in the order of nature;
 consequently there is no parallel.
"," Some have maintained that the pain of sense for demons
 and souls is postponed until the judgment day: and that the beatitude
 of the saints is likewise postponed until the judgment day. But this
 is erroneous, and contrary to the teaching of the Apostle (2 Cor.
 5:1): ""If our earthly house of this habitation be dissolved, we have
 a house in heaven."" Others, again, while not admitting the same of
 souls, admit it as to demons. But it is better to say that the same
 judgment is passed upon wicked souls and wicked angels, even as on
 good souls and good angels.

","Whether Corporeal Creatures Are from God?
"," It would seem that corporeal creatures are not from God.
 For it is said (Eccles. 3:14): ""I have learned that all the works
 which God hath made, continue for ever."" But visible bodies do not
 continue for ever, for it is said (2 Cor. 4:18): ""The things which are
 seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal.""
 Therefore God did not make visible bodies.
"," Further, it is said (Gen. 1:31): ""God saw all things that
 He had made, and they were very good."" But corporeal creatures are
 evil, since we find them harmful in many ways; as may be seen in
 serpents, in the sun's heat, and other things. Now a thing is called
 evil, in so far as it is harmful. Corporeal creatures, therefore,
 are not from God.
"," Further, what is from God does not withdraw us from God,
 but leads us to Him. But corporeal creatures withdraw us from God.
 Hence the Apostle (2 Cor. 4:18): ""While we look not at the things
 which are seen."" Corporeal creatures, therefore, are not from God.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," All the creatures of God in some respects continue for
 ever, at least as to matter, since what is created will never be
 annihilated, even though it be corruptible. And the nearer a creature
 approaches God, Who is immovable, the more it also is immovable. For
 corruptible creatures endure for ever as regards their matter, though
 they change as regards their substantial form. But incorruptible
 creatures endure with respect to their substance, though they are
 mutable in other respects, such as place, for instance, the heavenly
 bodies; or the affections, as spiritual creatures. But the Apostle's
 words, ""The things which are seen are temporal,"" though true even as
 regards such things considered in themselves (in so far as every
 visible creature is subject to time, either as to being or as to
 movement), are intended to apply to visible things in so far as they
 are offered to man as rewards. For such rewards, as consist in these
 visible things, are temporal; while those that are invisible endure
 for ever. Hence he said before (2 Cor. 4:17): ""It worketh for us . .
 . an eternal weight of glory.""
"," Corporeal creatures according to their nature are good,
 though this good is not universal, but partial and limited, the
 consequence of which is a certain opposition of contrary qualities,
 though each quality is good in itself. To those, however, who
 estimate things, not by the nature thereof, but by the good they
 themselves can derive therefrom, everything which is harmful to
 themselves seems simply evil. For they do not reflect that what is in
 some way injurious to one person, to another is beneficial, and that
 even to themselves the same thing may be evil in some respects, but
 good in others. And this could not be, if bodies were essentially
 evil and harmful.
"," Creatures of themselves do not withdraw us from God,
 but lead us to Him; for ""the invisible things of God are clearly
 seen, being understood by the things that are made"" (Rom. 1:20). If,
 then, they withdraw men from God, it is the fault of those who use
 them foolishly. Thus it is said (Wis. 14:11): ""Creatures are turned
 into a snare to the feet of the unwise."" And the very fact that they
 can thus withdraw us from God proves that they came from Him, for
 they cannot lead the foolish away from God except by the allurements
 of some good that they have from Him.

333,"[I, Q. 65, Art. 2]
","Whether Corporeal Things Were Made on Account of God's Goodness?
"," It would seem that corporeal creatures were not made
 on account of God's goodness. For it is said (Wis. 1:14) that God
 ""created all things that they might be."" Therefore all things were
 created for their own being's sake, and not on account of God's
 goodness.
"," Further, good has the nature of an end; therefore the
 greater good in things is the end of the lesser good. But spiritual
 creatures are related to corporeal creatures, as the greater good to
 the lesser. Corporeal creatures, therefore, are created for the sake
 of spiritual creatures, and not on account of God's goodness.
"," Further, justice does not give unequal things except to the
 unequal. Now God is just: therefore inequality not created by God
 must precede all inequality created by Him. But an inequality not
 created by God can only arise from free-will, and consequently all
 inequality results from the different movements of free-will. Now,
 corporeal creatures are unequal to spiritual creatures. Therefore the
 former were made on account of movements of free-will, and not on
 account of God's goodness.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," In the very fact of any creature possessing being, it
 represents the Divine being and Its goodness. And, therefore, that
 God created all things, that they might have being, does not exclude
 that He created them for His own goodness.
"," The proximate end does not exclude the ultimate end.
 Therefore that corporeal creatures were, in a manner, made for the
 sake of the spiritual, does not prevent their being made on account
 of God's goodness.
"," Equality of justice has its place in retribution, since
 equal rewards or punishments are due to equal merit or demerit. But
 this does not apply to things as at first instituted. For just as an
 architect, without injustice, places stones of the same kind in
 different parts of a building, not on account of any antecedent
 difference in the stones, but with a view to securing that perfection
 of the entire building, which could not be obtained except by the
 different positions of the stones; even so, God from the beginning,
 to secure perfection in the universe, has set therein creatures of
 various and unequal natures, according to His wisdom, and without
 injustice, since no diversity of merit is presupposed.

","Whether Corporeal Creatures Were Produced by God Through the Medium
"," It would seem that corporeal creatures were produced by
 God through the medium of the angels. For, as all things are governed
 by the Divine wisdom, so by it were all things made, according to Ps.
 103:24: ""Thou hast made all things in wisdom."" But ""it belongs to
 wisdom to ordain,"" as stated in the beginning of the Metaphysics
 (i, 2). Hence in the government of things the lower is ruled by the
 higher in a certain fitting order, as Augustine says (De Trin. iii,
 4). Therefore in the production of things it was ordained that the
 corporeal should be produced by the spiritual, as the lower by the
 higher.
"," Further, diversity of effects shows diversity of causes,
 since like always produces like. If then all creatures, both
 spiritual and corporeal, were produced immediately by God, there
 would be no diversity in creatures, for one would not be further
 removed from God than another. But this is clearly false; for the
 Philosopher says that some things are corruptible because they are
 far removed from God (De Gen. et Corrup. ii, text. 59).
"," Further, infinite power is not required to produce a finite
 effect. But every corporeal thing is finite. Therefore, it could be,
 and was, produced by the finite power of spiritual creatures: for in
 suchlike beings there is no distinction between what is and what is
 possible: especially as no dignity befitting a nature is denied to
 that nature, unless it be in punishment of a fault.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," In the production of things an order exists, but not
 such that one creature is created by another, for that is impossible;
 but rather such that by the Divine wisdom diverse grades are
 constituted in creatures.
"," God Himself, though one, has knowledge of many and
 different things without detriment to the simplicity of His nature,
 as has been shown above (Q. 15, A. 2); so that by His wisdom He is
 the cause of diverse things as known by Him, even as an artificer,
 by apprehending diverse forms, produces diverse works of art.
"," The amount of the power of an agent is measured not
 only by the thing made, but also by the manner of making it; for one
 and the same thing is made in one way by a higher power, in another
 by a lower. But the production of finite things, where nothing is
 presupposed as existing, is the work of infinite power, and, as
 such, can belong to no creature.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
335,"[I, Q. 65, Art. 4]
","Whether the Forms of Bodies Are from the Angels?
"," It would seem that the forms of bodies come from the
 angels. For Boethius says (De Trin. i): ""From forms that are without
 matter come the forms that are in matter."" But forms that are without
 matter are spiritual substances, and forms that are in matter are the
 forms of bodies. Therefore, the forms of bodies are from spiritual
 substances.
"," Further, all that is such by participation is reduced to that
 which is such by its essence. But spiritual substances are forms
 essentially, whereas corporeal creatures have forms by participation.
 Therefore the forms of corporeal things are derived from spiritual
 substances.
"," Further, spiritual substances have more power of causation
 than the heavenly bodies. But the heavenly bodies give form to things
 here below, for which reason they are said to cause generation and
 corruption. Much more, therefore, are material forms derived from
 spiritual substances.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," By immaterial forms Boethius understands the types of
 things in the mind of God. Thus the Apostle says (Heb. 11:3): ""By
 faith we understand that the world was framed by the Word of God;
 that from invisible things visible things might be made."" But if by
 immaterial forms he understands the angels, we say that from them
 come material forms, not by emanation, but by motion.
"," Forms received into matter are to be referred, not to
 self-subsisting forms of the same type, as the Platonists held, but
 either to intelligible forms of the angelic intellect, from which
 they proceed by movement, or, still higher, to the types in the
 Divine intellect, by which the seeds of forms are implanted in
 created things, that they may be able to be brought by movement
 into act.

 not by emanation.

 as a secondary cause imitates a first cause. But in the working of
 nature formlessness precedes form in time. It does so, therefore, in
 the Divine working.
"," Further, matter is higher than accident, for matter is part
 of substance. But God can effect that accident exist without
 substance, as in the Sacrament of the Altar. He could, therefore,
 cause matter to exist without form.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The word earth is taken differently in this passage by
 Augustine, and by other writers. Augustine holds that by the words
 ""earth"" and ""water,"" in this passage, primary matter itself is
 signified on account of its being impossible for Moses to make the
 idea of such matter intelligible to an ignorant people, except under
 the similitude of well-known objects. Hence he uses a variety of
 figures in speaking of it, calling it not water only, nor earth only,
 lest they should think it to be in very truth water or earth. At the
 same time it has so far a likeness to earth, in that it is
 susceptible of form, and to water in its adaptability to a variety
 of forms. In this respect, then, the earth is said to be ""void and
 empty,"" or ""invisible and shapeless,"" that matter is known by means
 of form. Hence, considered in itself, it is called ""invisible"" or
 ""void,"" and its potentiality is completed by form; thus Plato says
 that matter is ""place"" [*Timaeus, quoted by Aristotle, Phys. iv,
 text. 15]. But other holy writers understand by earth the element of
 earth, and we have said (A. 1) how, in this sense, the earth was,
 according to them, without form.
"," Nature produces effect in act from being in
 potentiality; and consequently in the operations of nature
 potentiality must precede act in time, and formlessness precede form.
 But God produces being in act out of nothing, and can, therefore,
 produce a perfect thing in an instant, according to the greatness of
 His power.
"," Accident, inasmuch as it is a form, is a kind of act;
 whereas matter, as such, is essentially being in potentiality. Hence
 it is more repugnant that matter should be in act without form, than
 for accident to be without subject.

","Whether the Formless Matter of All Corporeal Things Is the Same?
"," It would seem that the formless matter of all corporeal
 things is the same. For Augustine says (Confess. xii, 12): ""I find
 two things Thou hast made, one formed, the other formless,"" and he
 says that the latter was the earth invisible and shapeless, whereby,
 he says, the matter of all corporeal things is designated. Therefore
 the matter of all corporeal things is the same.
"," Further, the Philosopher says (Metaph. v, text. 10): ""Things
 that are one in genus are one in matter."" But all corporeal things
 are in the same genus of body. Therefore the matter of all bodies is
 the same.
"," Further, different acts befit different potentialities, and
 the same act befits the same potentiality. But all bodies have the
 same form, corporeity. Therefore all bodies have the same matter.
"," Further, matter, considered in itself, is only in
 potentiality. But distinction is due to form. Therefore matter
 considered in itself is the same in all corporeal things.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," Augustine follows in this the opinion of Plato,
 who does not admit a fifth essence. Or we may say that formless matter
 is one with the unity of order, as all bodies are one in the order of
 corporeal creatures.
"," If genus is taken in a physical sense,
 corruptible and incorruptible things are not in the same genus, on
 account of their different modes of potentiality, as is said in
 Metaph. x, text. 26. Logically considered, however, there is but one
 genus of all bodies, since they are all included in the one notion of
 corporeity.
"," The form of corporeity is not one and the same
 in all bodies, being no other than the various forms by which bodies
 are distinguished, as stated above.
"," As potentiality is directed towards act,
 potential beings are differentiated by their different acts, as sight
 is by color, hearing by sound. Therefore for this reason the matter of
 the celestial bodies is different from that of the elemental, because
 the matter of the celestial is not in potentiality to an elemental
 form.

338,"[I, Q. 66, Art. 3]
","Whether the Empyrean Heaven Was Created at the Same Time As Formless
"," It would seem that the empyrean heaven was not created
 at the same time as formless matter. For the empyrean, if it is
 anything at all, must be a sensible body. But all sensible bodies are
 movable, and the empyrean heaven is not movable. For if it were so,
 its movement would be ascertained by the movement of some visible
 body, which is not the case. The empyrean heaven, then, was not
 created contemporaneously with formless matter.
"," Further, Augustine says (De Trin. iii, 4) that ""the lower
 bodies are governed by the higher in a certain order."" If, therefore,
 the empyrean heaven is the highest of bodies, it must necessarily
 exercise some influence on bodies below it. But this does not seem to
 be the case, especially as it is presumed to be without movement; for
 one body cannot move another unless itself also be moved. Therefore
 the empyrean heaven was not created together with formless matter.
"," Further, if it is held that the empyrean heaven is the place
 of contemplation, and not ordained to natural effects; on the
 contrary, Augustine says (De Trin. iv, 20): ""In so far as we mentally
 apprehend eternal things, so far are we not of this world""; from
 which it is clear that contemplation lifts the mind above the things
 of this world. Corporeal place, therefore, cannot be the seat of
 contemplation.
"," Further, among the heavenly bodies exists a body, partly
 transparent and partly luminous, which we call the sidereal heaven.
 There exists also a heaven wholly transparent, called by some the
 aqueous or crystalline heaven. If, then, there exists a still higher
 heaven, it must be wholly luminous. But this cannot be, for then the
 air would be constantly illuminated, and there would be no night.
 Therefore the empyrean heaven was not created together with formless
 matter.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," Sensible corporeal things are movable in the present
 state of the world, for by the movement of corporeal creatures is
 secured by the multiplication of the elements. But when glory is
 finally consummated, the movement of bodies will cease. And such must
 have been from the beginning the condition of the empyrean.
"," It is sufficiently probable, as some assert, that the
 empyrean heaven, having the state of glory for its ordained end, does
 not influence inferior bodies of another order--those, namely, that
 are directed only to natural ends. Yet it seems still more probable
 that it does influence bodies that are moved, though itself
 motionless, just as angels of the highest rank, who assist [*Infra,
 Q. 112, A. 3], influence those of lower degree who act as messengers,
 though they themselves are not sent, as Dionysius teaches (Coel.
 Hier. xii). For this reason it may be said that the influence of the
 empyrean upon that which is called the first heaven, and is moved,
 produces therein not something that comes and goes as a result of
 movement, but something of a fixed and stable nature, as the power of
 conservation or causation, or something of the kind pertaining to
 dignity.
"," Corporeal place is assigned to contemplation, not as
 necessary, but as congruous, that the splendor without may correspond
 to that which is within. Hence Basil (Hom. ii in Hexaem.) says: ""The
 ministering spirit could not live in darkness, but made his habitual
 dwelling in light and joy.""
"," As Basil says (Hom. ii in Hexaem.): ""It is certain that
 the heaven was created spherical in shape, of dense body, and
 sufficiently strong to separate what is outside it from what it
 encloses. On this account it darkens the region external to it, the
 light by which itself is lit up being shut out from that region."" But
 since the body of the firmament, though solid, is transparent, for
 that it does not exclude light (as is clear from the fact that we can
 see the stars through the intervening heavens), we may also say that
 the empyrean has light, not condensed so as to emit rays, as the sun
 does, but of a more subtle nature. Or it may have the brightness of
 glory which differs from mere natural brightness.

","Whether Time Was Created Simultaneously with Formless Matter?
"," It would seem that time was not created simultaneously
 with formless matter. For Augustine says (Confess. xii, 12): ""I find
 two things that Thou didst create before time was, the primary
 corporeal matter, and the angelic nature. ""Therefore time was not
 created with formless matter.
"," Further, time is divided by day and night. But in the
 beginning there was neither day nor night, for these began when ""God
 divided the light from the darkness."" Therefore in the beginning
 time was not.
"," Further, time is the measure of the firmament's movement;
 and the firmament is said to have been made on the second day.
 Therefore in the beginning time was not.
"," Further, movement precedes time, and therefore should be
 reckoned among the first things created, rather than time.
"," Further, as time is the extrinsic measure of created
 things, so is place. Place, then, as truly as time, must be
 reckoned among the things first created.
",,,,,,,,,,,,," The teaching of Augustine rests on the opinion that the
 angelic nature and formless matter precede time by origin or nature.
"," As in the opinion of some holy writers matter was in
 some measure formless before it received its full form, so time was
 in a manner formless before it was fully formed and distinguished
 into day and night.
"," If the movement of the firmament did not begin
 immediately from the beginning, then the time that preceded was the
 measure, not of the firmament's movement, but of the first movement
 of whatsoever kind. For it is accidental to time to be the measure of
 the firmament's movement, in so far as this is the first movement.
 But if the first movement was another than this, time would have been
 its measure, for everything is measured by the first of its kind. And
 it must be granted that forthwith from the beginning, there was
 movement of some kind, at least in the succession of concepts and
 affections in the angelic mind: while movement without time cannot be
 conceived, since time is nothing else than ""the measure of priority
 and succession in movement.""
"," Among the first created things are to be reckoned those
 which have a general relationship to things. And, therefore, among
 these time must be included, as having the nature of a common
 measure; but not movement, which is related only to the movable
 subject.
"," Place is implied as existing in the empyrean heaven,
 this being the boundary of the universe. And since place has
 reference to things permanent, it was created at once in its
 totality. But time, as not being permanent, was created in its
 beginning: even as actually we cannot lay hold of any part of
 time save the ""now.""

 ""in spiritual things light is better and surer: and that Christ is
 not called Light in the same sense as He is called the Stone; the
 former is to be taken literally, and the latter metaphorically.""
"," Further, Dionysius (Div. Nom. iv) includes Light among the
 intellectual names of God. But such names are used in their proper
 sense in spiritual things. Therefore light is used in its proper
 sense in spiritual matters.

 manifest is light."" But to be made manifest belongs more properly
 to spiritual things than to corporeal. Therefore also does light.

","Whether Light Is a Body?
"," It would seem that light is a body. For Augustine says
 (De Lib. Arb. iii, 5) that ""light takes the first place among
 bodies.""Therefore light is a body.
"," Further, the Philosopher says (Topic. v, 2) that ""light is a
 species of fire."" But fire is a body, and therefore so is light.
"," Further, the powers of movement, intersection, reflection,
 belong properly to bodies; and all these are attributes of light and
 its rays. Moreover, different rays of light, as Dionysius says (Div.
 Nom. ii) are united and separated, which seems impossible unless they
 are bodies. Therefore light is a body.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Augustine takes light to be a luminous body in act--in
 other words, to be fire, the noblest of the four elements.
"," Aristotle pronounces light to be fire existing in its
 own proper matter: just as fire in aerial matter is ""flame,"" or in
 earthly matter is ""burning coal."" Nor must too much attention be paid
 to the instances adduced by Aristotle in his works on logic, as he
 merely mentions them as the more or less probable opinions of various
 writers.
"," All these properties are assigned to light
 metaphorically, and might in the same way be attributed to heat. For
 because movement from place to place is naturally first in the order
 of movement as is proved Phys. viii, text. 55, we use terms
 belonging to local movement in speaking of alteration and movement of
 all kinds. For even the word distance is derived from the idea of
 remoteness of place, to that of all contraries, as is said Metaph.
 x, text. 13.

","Whether Light Is a Quality?
"," It would seem that light is not a quality. For every
 quality remains in its subject, though the active cause of the
 quality be removed, as heat remains in water removed from the fire.
 But light does not remain in the air when the source of light is
 withdrawn. Therefore light is not a quality.
"," Further, every sensible quality has its opposite, as cold is
 opposed to heat, blackness to whiteness. But this is not the case
 with light since darkness is merely a privation of light. Light
 therefore is not a sensible quality.
"," Further, a cause is more potent than its effect. But the
 light of the heavenly bodies is a cause of substantial forms of
 earthly bodies, and also gives to colors their immaterial being, by
 making them actually visible. Light, then, is not a sensible quality,
 but rather a substantial or spiritual form.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Since quality is consequent upon substantial form, the
 mode in which the subject receives a quality differs as the mode
 differs in which a subject receives a substantial form. For when
 matter receives its form perfectly, the qualities consequent upon the
 form are firm and enduring; as when, for instance, water is converted
 into fire. When, however, substantial form is received imperfectly,
 so as to be, as it were, in process of being received, rather than
 fully impressed, the consequent quality lasts for a time but is not
 permanent; as may be seen when water which has been heated returns
 in time to its natural state. But light is not produced by the
 transmutation of matter, as though matter were in receipt of a
 substantial form, and light were a certain inception of substantial
 form. For this reason light disappears on the disappearance of its
 active cause.
"," It is accidental to light not to have a contrary,
 forasmuch as it is the natural quality of the first corporeal cause
 of change, which is itself removed from contrariety.
"," As heat acts towards perfecting the form of fire, as an
 instrumental cause, by virtue of the substantial form, so does light
 act instrumentally, by virtue of the heavenly bodies, towards
 producing substantial forms; and towards rendering colors actually
 visible, inasmuch as it is a quality of the first sensible body.

","Whether the Production of Light Is Fittingly Assigned to the First
"," It would seem that the production of light is not
 fittingly assigned to the first day. For light, as stated above (A.
 3), is a quality. But qualities are accidents, and as such should
 have, not the first, but a subordinate place. The production of
 light, then, ought not to be assigned to the first day.
"," Further, it is light that distinguishes night from day, and
 this is effected by the sun, which is recorded as having been made on
 the fourth day. Therefore the production of light could not have been
 on the first day.
"," Further, night and day are brought about by the circular
 movement of a luminous body. But movement of this kind is an
 attribute of the firmament, and we read that the firmament was made
 on the second day. Therefore the production of light, dividing night
 from day, ought not to be assigned to the first day.
"," Further, if it be said that spiritual light is here spoken
 of, it may be replied that the light made on the first day dispels
 the darkness. But in the beginning spiritual darkness was not, for
 even the demons were in the beginning good, as has been shown (Q. 63,
 A. 5). Therefore the production of light ought not to be assigned to
 the first day.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," According to the opinion of those who hold that the
 formlessness of matter preceded its form in duration, matter must be
 held to have been created at the beginning with substantial forms,
 afterwards receiving those that are accidental, among which light
 holds the first place.
"," In the opinion of some the light here spoken of was a
 kind of luminous nebula, and that on the making of the sun this
 returned to the matter of which it had been formed. But this cannot
 well be maintained, as in the beginning of Genesis Holy Scripture
 records the institution of that order of nature which henceforth is
 to endure. We cannot, then, say that what was made at that time
 afterwards ceased to exist.
"," Basil says (Hom. ii in Hexaem.) that day and night were
 then caused by expansion and contraction of light, rather than by
 movement. But Augustine objects to this (Gen. ad lit. i), that there
 was no reason for this vicissitude of expansion and contraction since
 there were neither men nor animals on the earth at that time, for
 whose service this was required. Nor does the nature of a luminous
 body seem to admit of the withdrawal of light, so long as the body is
 actually present; though this might be effected by a miracle. As to
 this, however, Augustine remarks (Gen. ad lit. i) that in the first
 founding of the order of nature we must not look for miracles, but
 for what is in accordance with nature. We hold, then, that the
 movement of the heavens is twofold. Of these movements, one is common
 to the entire heaven, and is the cause of day and night. This, as it
 seems, had its beginning on the first day. The other varies in
 proportion as it affects various bodies, and by its variations is the
 cause of the succession of days, months, and years. Thus it is, that
 in the account of the first day the distinction between day and night
 alone is mentioned; this distinction being brought about by the
 common movement of the heavens. The further distinction into
 successive days, seasons, and years recorded as begun on the fourth
 day, in the words, ""let them be for seasons, and for days, and years""
 is due to proper movements.
"," As Augustine teaches (Confess. xii; Gen. ad lit. 1,
 15), formlessness did not precede forms in duration; and so we must
 understand the production of light to signify the formation of
 spiritual creatures, not, indeed, with the perfection of glory, in
 which they were not created, but with the perfection of grace, which
 they possessed from their creation as said above (Q. 62, A. 3). Thus
 the division of light from darkness will denote the distinction of
 the spiritual creature from other created things as yet without form.
 But if all created things received their form at the same time, the
 darkness must be held to mean the spiritual darkness of the wicked,
 not as existing from the beginning but such as God foresaw would
 exist.

","Whether the Firmament Was Made on the Second Day?
"," It would seem that the firmament was not made on the
 second day. For it is said (Gen. 1:8): ""God called the firmament
 heaven."" But the heaven existed before days, as is clear from the
 words, ""In the beginning God created heaven and earth."" Therefore
 the firmament was not made on the second day.
"," Further, the work of the six days is ordered conformably to
 the order of Divine wisdom. Now it would ill become the Divine wisdom
 to make afterwards that which is naturally first. But though the
 firmament naturally precedes the earth and the waters, these are
 mentioned before the formation of light, which was on the first day.
 Therefore the firmament was not made on the second day.
"," Further, all that was made in the six days was formed out of
 matter created before days began. But the firmament cannot have been
 formed out of pre-existing matter, for if so it would be liable to
 generation and corruption. Therefore the firmament was not made on
 the second day.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," According to Chrysostom (Hom. iii in Genes.), Moses
 prefaces his record by speaking of the works of God collectively, in
 the words, ""In the beginning God created heaven and earth,"" and then
 proceeds to explain them part by part; in somewhat the same way as
 one might say: ""This house was constructed by that builder,"" and then
 add: ""First, he laid the foundations, then built the walls, and
 thirdly, put on the roof."" In accepting this explanation we are,
 therefore, not bound to hold that a different heaven is spoken of in
 the words: ""In the beginning God created heaven and earth,"" and when
 we read that the firmament was made on the second day.

345,"[I, Q. 68, Art. 2]
","Whether There Are Waters Above the Firmament?
"," It would seem that there are not waters above the
 firmament. For water is heavy by nature, and heavy things tend
 naturally downwards, not upwards. Therefore there are not waters
 above the firmament.
"," Further, water is fluid by nature, and fluids cannot rest
 on a sphere, as experience shows. Therefore, since the firmament is a
 sphere, there cannot be water above it.
"," Further, water is an element, and appointed to the
 generation of composite bodies, according to the relation in which
 imperfect things stand towards perfect. But bodies of composite nature
 have their place upon the earth, and not above the firmament, so that
 water would be useless there. But none of God's works are useless.
 Therefore there are not waters above the firmament.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Some have attempted to solve this difficulty by
 supposing that in spite of the natural gravity of water, it is kept in
 its place above the firmament by the Divine power. Augustine (Gen. ad
 lit. ii, 1), however will not admit this solution, but says ""It is our
 business here to inquire how God has constituted the natures of His
 creatures, not how far it may have pleased Him to work on them by way
 of miracle."" We leave this view, then, and answer that according to
 the last two opinions on the firmament and the waters the solution
 appears from what has been said. According to the first opinion, an
 order of the elements must be supposed different from that given by
 Aristotle, that is to say, that the waters surrounding the earth are
 of a dense consistency, and those around the firmament of a rarer
 consistency, in proportion to the respective density of the earth
 and of the heaven.
"," The solution is clear from what has been said,
 according to the last two opinions. But according to the first
 opinion, Basil gives two replies (Hom. iii in Hexaem.). He answers
 first, that a body seen as concave beneath need not necessarily be
 rounded, or convex, above. Secondly, that the waters above the
 firmament are not fluid, but exist outside it in a solid state, as a
 mass of ice, and that this is the crystalline heaven of some writers.
"," According to the third opinion given, the waters above
 the firmament have been raised in the form of vapors, and serve to
 give rain to the earth. But according to the second opinion, they
 are above the heaven that is wholly transparent and starless. This,
 according to some, is the primary mobile, the cause of the daily
 revolution of the entire heaven, whereby the continuance of
 generation is secured. In the same way the starry heaven, by the
 zodiacal movement, is the cause whereby different bodies are
 generated or corrupted, through the rising and setting of the stars,
 and their various influences. But according to the first opinion
 these waters are set there to temper the heat of the celestial
 bodies, as Basil supposes (Hom. iii in Hexaem.). And Augustine says
 (Gen. ad lit. ii, 5) that some have considered this to be proved by
 the extreme cold of Saturn owing to its nearness to the waters that
 are above the firmament.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
346,"[I, Q. 68, Art. 3]
","Whether the Firmament Divides Waters from Waters?
"," It would seem that the firmament does not divide waters
 from waters. For bodies that are of one and the same species have
 naturally one and the same place. But the Philosopher says (Topic.
 i, 6): ""All water is the same species."" Water therefore cannot be
 distinct from water by place.
"," Further, should it be said that the waters above the
 firmament differ in species from those under the firmament, it may be
 argued, on the contrary, that things distinct in species need nothing
 else to distinguish them. If then, these waters differ in species, it
 is not the firmament that distinguishes them.
"," Further, it would appear that what distinguishes waters from
 waters must be something which is in contact with them on either
 side, as a wall standing in the midst of a river. But it is evident
 that the waters below do not reach up to the firmament. Therefore
 the firmament does not divide the waters from the waters.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," If by the firmament is understood the starry heaven,
 the waters above are not of the same species as those beneath. But
 if by the firmament is understood the cloudy region of the air, both
 these waters are of the same species, and two places are assigned to
 them, though not for the same purpose, the higher being the place of
 their begetting, the lower, the place of their repose.
"," If the waters are held to differ in species, the
 firmament cannot be said to divide the waters, as the cause of
 their destruction, but only as the boundary of each.
"," On account of the air and other similar bodies being
 invisible, Moses includes all such bodies under the name of water,
 and thus it is evident that waters are found on each side of the
 firmament, whatever be the sense in which the word is used.

347,"[I, Q. 68, Art. 4]
","Whether There Is Only One Heaven?
"," It would seem that there is only one heaven. For the
 heaven is contrasted with the earth, in the words, ""In the beginning
 God created heaven and earth."" But there is only one earth. Therefore
 there is only one heaven.
"," Further, that which consists of the entire sum of its own
 matter, must be one; and such is the heaven, as the Philosopher
 proves (De Coel. i, text. 95). Therefore there is but one heaven.
"," Further, whatever is predicated of many things univocally
 is predicated of them according to some common notion. But if there
 are more heavens than one, they are so called univocally, for if
 equivocally only, they could not properly be called many. If, then,
 they are many, there must be some common notion by reason of which
 each is called heaven, but this common notion cannot be assigned.
 Therefore there cannot be more than one heaven.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The earth stands in relation to the heaven as the
 centre of a circle to its circumference. But as one center may have
 many circumferences, so, though there is but one earth, there may be
 many heavens.
"," The argument holds good as to the heaven, in so far as
 it denotes the entire sum of corporeal creation, for in that sense it
 is one.
"," All the heavens have in common sublimity and some
 degree of luminosity, as appears from what has been said.

348,"[I, Q. 69, Art. 1]
","Whether It Was Fitting That the Gathering Together of the Waters
"," It would seem that it was not fitting that the gathering
 together of the waters should take place on the third day. For what
 was made on the first and second days is expressly said to have been
 ""made"" in the words, ""God said: Be light made,"" and ""Let there be a
 firmament made.""But the third day is contradistinguished from the
 first and the second days. Therefore the work of the third day
 should have been described as a making not as a gathering together.
"," Further, the earth hitherto had been completely covered by
 the waters, wherefore it was described as ""invisible"" [* See Q. 66,
 A. 1, Obj. 1]. There was then no place on the earth to which the
 waters could be gathered together.
"," A. 1, Obj. 1]. There was then no place on the earth to which the
 waters could be gathered together.
"," Further, things which are not in continuous contact cannot
 occupy one place. But not all the waters are in continuous contact,
 and therefore all were not gathered together into one place.
"," Further, a gathering together is a mode of local movement.
 But the waters flow naturally, and take their course towards the sea.
 In their case, therefore, a Divine precept of this kind was
 unnecessary.
"," Further, the earth is given its name at its first creation by
 the words, ""In the beginning God created heaven and earth."" Therefore
 the imposition of its name on the third day seems to be recorded
 without necessity.
",,,,,,,,,,,," According to Augustine [*Gen. ad lit. ii, 7, 8; iii,
 20], Scripture does not say of the work of the third day, that it was
 made, as it says of those that precede, in order to show that higher
 and spiritual forms, such as the angels and the heavenly bodies, are
 perfect and stable in being, whereas inferior forms are imperfect and
 mutable. Hence the impression of such forms is signified by the
 gathering of the waters, and the appearing of the land. For ""water,""
 to use Augustine's words, ""glides and flows away, the earth abides""
 (Gen. ad lit. ii, 11). Others, again, hold that the work of the third
 day was perfected on that day only as regards movement from place to
 place, and that for this reason Scripture had no reason to speak of
 it as made.
"," This argument is easily solved, according to
 Augustine's opinion (De Gen. Contr. Manich. i), because we need not
 suppose that the earth was first covered by the waters, and that
 these were afterwards gathered together, but that they were produced
 in this very gathering together. But according to the other writers
 there are three solutions, which Augustine gives (Gen. ad lit. i,
 12). The first supposes that the waters are heaped up to a greater
 height at the place where they were gathered together, for it has
 been proved in regard to the Red Sea, that the sea is higher than the
 land, as Basil remarks (Hom. iv in Hexaem.). The second explains the
 water that covered the earth as being rarefied or nebulous, which was
 afterwards condensed when the waters were gathered together. The
 third suggests the existence of hollows in the earth, to receive the
 confluence of waters. Of the above the first seems the most probable.
"," All the waters have the sea as their goal, into which
 they flow by channels hidden or apparent, and this may be the reason
 why they are said to be gathered together into one place. Or, ""one
 place"" is to be understood not simply, but as contrasted with the
 place of the dry land, so that the sense would be, ""Let the waters be
 gathered together in one place,"" that is, apart from the dry land.
 That the waters occupied more places than one seems to be implied by
 the words that follow, ""The gathering together of the waters He
 called Seas.""
"," The Divine command gives bodies their natural movement
 and by these natural movements they are said to ""fulfill His word.""
 Or we may say that it was according to the nature of water completely
 to cover the earth, just as the air completely surrounds both water
 and earth; but as a necessary means towards an end, namely, that
 plants and animals might be on the earth, it was necessary for the
 waters to be withdrawn from a portion of the earth. Some philosophers
 attribute this uncovering of the earth's surface to the action of the
 sun lifting up the vapors and thus drying the land. Scripture,
 however, attributes it to the Divine power, not only in the Book of
 Genesis, but also Job 38:10 where in the person of the Lord it is
 said, ""I set My bounds around the sea,"" and Jer. 5:22, where it is
 written: ""Will you not then fear Me, saith the Lord, who have set
 the sand a bound for the sea?""
"," According to Augustine (De Gen. Contr. Manich. i),
 primary matter is meant by the word earth, where first mentioned,
 but in the present passage it is to be taken for the element itself.
 Again it may be said with Basil (Hom. iv in Hexaem.), that the earth
 is mentioned in the first passage in respect of its nature, but here
 in respect of its principal property, namely, dryness. Wherefore it
 is written: ""He called the dry land, Earth."" It may also be said with
 Rabbi Moses, that the expression, ""He called,"" denotes throughout an
 equivocal use of the name imposed. Thus we find it said at first that
 ""He called the light Day"": for the reason that later on a period of
 twenty-four hours is also called day, where it is said that ""there
 was evening and morning, one day."" In like manner it is said that
 ""the firmament,"" that is, the air, ""He called heaven"": for that which
 was first created was also called ""heaven."" And here, again, it is
 said that ""the dry land,"" that is, the part from which the waters had
 withdrawn, ""He called, Earth,"" as distinct from the sea; although the
 name earth is equally applied to that which is covered with waters or
 not. So by the expression ""He called"" we are to understand throughout
 that the nature or property He bestowed corresponded to the name He
 gave.

349,"[I, Q. 69, Art. 2]
","Whether It Was Fitting That the Production of Plants Should Take Place
"," It would seem that it was not fitting that the production
 of plants should take place on the third day. For plants have life, as
 animals have. But the production of animals belongs to the work, not
 of distinction, but of adornment. Therefore the production of plants,
 as also belonging to the work of adornment, ought not to be recorded
 as taking place on the third day, which is devoted to the work of
 distinction.
"," Further, a work by which the earth is accursed should have
 been recorded apart from the work by which it receives its form. But
 the words of Gen. 3:17, ""Cursed is the earth in thy work, thorns and
 thistles shall it bring forth to thee,"" show that by the production
 of certain plants the earth was accursed. Therefore the production of
 plants in general should not have been recorded on the third day,
 which is concerned with the work of formation.
"," Further, as plants are firmly fixed to the earth, so are
 stones and metals, which are, nevertheless, not mentioned in the work
 of formation. Plants, therefore, ought not to have been made on the
 third day.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Life in plants is hidden, since they lack sense and
 local movement, by which the animate and the inanimate are chiefly
 discernible. And therefore, since they are firmly fixed in the earth,
 their production is treated as a part of the earth's formation.
"," Even before the earth was accursed, thorns and thistles
 had been produced, either virtually or actually. But they were not
 produced in punishment of man; as though the earth, which he tilled
 to gain his food, produced unfruitful and noxious plants. Hence it is
 said: ""Shall it bring forth to thee.""
"," Moses put before the people such things only as were
 manifest to their senses, as we have said (Q. 67, A. 4; Q. 68, A. 3).
 But minerals are generated in hidden ways within the bowels of the
 earth. Moreover they seem hardly specifically distinct from earth,
 and would seem to be species thereof. For this reason, therefore, he
 makes no mention of them.

350,"[I, Q. 70, Art. 1]
","Whether the Lights Ought to Have Been Produced on the Fourth Day?
"," It would seem that the lights ought not to have been
 produced on the fourth day. For the heavenly luminaries are by nature
 incorruptible bodies: wherefore their matter cannot exist without
 their form. But as their matter was produced in the work of creation,
 before there was any day, so therefore were their forms. It follows,
 then, that the lights were not produced on the fourth day.
"," Further, the luminaries are, as it were, vessels of light.
 But light was made on the first day. The luminaries, therefore,
 should have been made on the first day, not on the fourth.
"," Further, the lights are fixed in the firmament, as plants
 are fixed in the earth. For, the Scripture says: ""He set them in the
 firmament."" But plants are described as produced when the earth, to
 which they are attached, received its form. The lights, therefore,
 should have been produced at the same time as the firmament, that is
 to say, on the second day.
"," Further, plants are an effect of the sun, moon, and other
 heavenly bodies. Now, cause precedes effect in the order of nature.
 The lights, therefore, ought not to have been produced on the fourth
 day, but on the third day.
"," Further, as astronomers say, there are many stars larger than
 the moon. Therefore the sun and the moon alone are not correctly
 described as the ""two great lights.""
",,,,,,,,,,,,," In Augustine's opinion there is no difficulty here; for
 he does not hold a succession of time in these works, and so there
 was no need for the matter of the lights to exist under another form.
 Nor is there any difficulty in the opinion of those who hold the
 heavenly bodies to be of the nature of the four elements, for it may
 be said that they were formed out of matter already existing, as
 animals and plants were formed. For those, however, who hold the
 heavenly bodies to be of another nature from the elements, and
 naturally incorruptible, the answer must be that the lights were
 substantially created at the beginning, but that their substance, at
 first formless, is formed on this day, by receiving not its
 substantial form, but a determination of power. As to the fact that
 the lights are not mentioned as existing from the beginning, but only
 as made on the fourth day, Chrysostom (Hom. vi in Gen.) explains this
 by the need of guarding the people from the danger of idolatry: since
 the lights are proved not to be gods, by the fact that they were not
 from the beginning.
"," No difficulty exists if we follow Augustine in holding
 the light made on the first day to be spiritual, and that made on
 this day to be corporeal. If, however, the light made on the first
 day is understood to be itself corporeal, then it must be held to
 have been produced on that day merely as light in general; and that
 on the fourth day the lights received a definite power to produce
 determinate effects. Thus we observe that the rays of the sun have
 one effect, those of the moon another, and so forth. Hence, speaking
 of such a determination of power, Dionysius (Div. Nom. iv) says that
 the sun's light which previously was without form, was formed on the
 fourth day.
"," According to Ptolemy the heavenly luminaries are not
 fixed in the spheres, but have their own movement distinct from the
 movement of the spheres. Wherefore Chrysostom says (Hom. vi in Gen.)
 that He is said to have set them in the firmament, not because He
 fixed them there immovably, but because He bade them to be there,
 even as He placed man in Paradise, to be there. In the opinion of
 Aristotle, however, the stars are fixed in their orbits, and in
 reality have no other movement but that of the spheres; and yet our
 senses perceive the movement of the luminaries and not that of the
 spheres (De Coel. ii, text. 43). But Moses describes what is obvious
 to sense, out of condescension to popular ignorance, as we have
 already said (Q. 67, A. 4; Q. 68, A. 3). The objection, however,
 falls to the ground if we regard the firmament made on the second day
 as having a natural distinction from that in which the stars are
 placed, even though the distinction is not apparent to the senses,
 the testimony of which Moses follows, as stated above (De Coel. ii,
 text. 43). For although to the senses there appears but one
 firmament; if we admit a higher and a lower firmament, the lower will
 be that which was made on the second day, and on the fourth the stars
 were fixed in the higher firmament.
"," In the words of Basil (Hom. v in Hexaem.), plants were
 recorded as produced before the sun and moon, to prevent idolatry,
 since those who believe the heavenly bodies to be gods, hold that
 plants originate primarily from these bodies. Although as Chrysostom
 remarks (Hom. vi in Gen.), the sun, moon, and stars cooperate in the
 work of production by their movements, as the husbandman cooperates
 by his labor.
"," As Chrysostom says, the two lights are called great,
 not so much with regard to their dimensions as to their influence and
 power. For though the stars be of greater bulk than the moon, yet the
 influence of the moon is more perceptible to the senses in this lower
 world. Moreover, as far as the senses are concerned, its apparent
 size is greater.
",,,,,,,,,,,
351,"[I, Q. 70, Art. 2]
","Whether the Cause Assigned for the Production of the Lights Is
"," It would seem that the cause assigned for the production
 of the lights is not reasonable. For it is said (Jer. 10:2): ""Be not
 afraid of the signs of heaven, which the heathens fear."" Therefore the
 heavenly lights were not made to be signs.
"," Further, sign is contradistinguished from cause. But the
 lights are the cause of what takes place upon the earth. Therefore
 they are not signs.
"," Further, the distinction of seasons and days began from the
 first day. Therefore the lights were not made ""for seasons, and days,
 and years,"" that is, in order to distinguish them.
"," Further, nothing is made for the sake of that which is
 inferior to itself, ""since the end is better than the means"" (Topic.
 iii). But the lights are nobler than the earth. Therefore they were
 not made ""to enlighten it.""
"," Further, the new moon cannot be said ""to rule the night."" But
 such it probably did when first made; for men begin to count from the
 new moon. The moon, therefore, was not made ""to rule the night.""
",,,,,,,,,,,,," The lights in the heaven are set for signs of changes
 effected in corporeal creatures, but not of those changes which
 depend upon the free-will.
"," We are sometimes brought to the knowledge of hidden
 effects through their sensible causes, and conversely. Hence nothing
 prevents a sensible cause from being a sign. But he says ""signs,""
 rather than ""causes,"" to guard against idolatry.
"," The general division of time into day and night took
 place on the first day, as regards the diurnal movement, which is
 common to the whole heaven and may be understood to have begun on
 that first day. But the particular distinctions of days and seasons
 and years, according as one day is hotter than another, one season
 than another, and one year than another, are due to certain
 particular movements of the stars: which movements may have had their
 beginning on the fourth day.
"," Light was given to the earth for the service of man,
 who, by reason of his soul, is nobler than the heavenly bodies. Nor
 is it untrue to say that a higher creature may be made for the sake
 of a lower, considered not in itself, but as ordained to the good of
 the universe.
"," When the moon is at its perfection it rises in the
 evening and sets in the morning, and thus it rules the night, and it
 was probably made in its full perfection as were plants yielding
 seed, as also were animals and man himself. For although the perfect
 is developed from the imperfect by natural processes, yet the perfect
 must exist simply before the imperfect. Augustine, however (Gen. ad
 lit. ii), does not say this, for he says that it is not unfitting
 that God made things imperfect, which He afterwards perfected.
",,,,,,,,,,,
352,"[I, Q. 70, Art. 3]
","Whether the Lights of Heaven Are Living Beings?
"," It would seem that the lights of heaven are living
 beings. For the nobler a body is, the more nobly it should be adorned.
 But a body less noble than the heaven, is adorned with living beings,
 with fish, birds, and the beasts of the field. Therefore the lights of
 heaven, as pertaining to its adornment, should be living beings also.
"," Further, the nobler a body is, the nobler must be its form.
 But the sun, moon, and stars are nobler bodies than plants or
 animals, and must therefore have nobler forms. Now the noblest of all
 forms is the soul, as being the first principle of life. Hence
 Augustine (De Vera Relig. xxix) says: ""Every living substance stands
 higher in the order of nature than one that has not life."" The lights
 of heaven, therefore, are living beings.
"," Further, a cause is nobler than its effect. But the sun,
 moon, and stars are a cause of life, as is especially evidenced in
 the case of animals generated from putrefaction, which receive life
 from the power of the sun and stars. Much more, therefore, have the
 heavenly bodies a living soul.
"," Further, the movement of the heaven and the heavenly bodies
 are natural (De Coel. i, text. 7, 8): and natural movement is from an
 intrinsic principle. Now the principle of movement in the heavenly
 bodies is a substance capable of apprehension, and is moved as the
 desirer is moved by the object desired (Metaph. xii, text. 36).
 Therefore, seemingly, the apprehending principle is intrinsic to the
 heavenly bodies: and consequently they are living beings.
"," Further, the first of movables is the heaven. Now, of all
 things that are endowed with movement the first moves itself, as is
 proved in Phys. viii, text. 34, because, what is such of itself
 precedes that which is by another. But only beings that are living
 move themselves, as is shown in the same book (text. 27). Therefore
 the heavenly bodies are living beings.
"," It would seem that this work is not fittingly described.
 For the waters produce that which the power of water suffices to
 produce. But the power of water does not suffice for the production
 of every kind of fishes and birds since we find that many of them are
 generated from seed. Therefore the words, ""Let the waters bring forth
 the creeping creature having life, and the fowl that may fly over the
 earth,"" do not fittingly describe this work.
"," Further, fishes and birds are not produced from water only,
 but earth seems to predominate over water in their composition, as is
 shown by the fact that their bodies tend naturally to the earth and
 rest upon it. It is not, then, fittingly said that fishes and birds
 are produced from water.
"," Further, fishes move in the waters, and birds in the air. If,
 then, fishes are produced from the waters, birds ought to be produced
 from the air, and not from the waters.
"," Further, not all fishes creep through the waters, for some,
 as seals, have feet and walk on land. Therefore the production of
 fishes is not sufficiently described by the words, ""Let the waters
 bring forth the creeping creature having life.""
"," Further, land animals are more perfect than birds and fishes
 which appears from the fact that they have more distinct limbs, and
 generation of a higher order. For they bring forth living beings,
 whereas birds and fishes bring forth eggs. But the more perfect has
 precedence in the order of nature. Therefore fishes and birds ought
 not to have been produced on the fifth day, before land animals.
"," Further, a genus ought not to be opposed to its species. But
 beasts and cattle are quadrupeds. Therefore quadrupeds ought not to
 be enumerated as a class with beasts and cattle.
"," Further, as animals belong to a determinate genus and
 species, so also does man. But in the making of man nothing is said
 of his genus and species, and therefore nothing ought to have been
 said about them in the production of other animals, whereas it is
 said ""according to its genus"" and ""in its species.""
"," Further, land animals are more like man, whom God is recorded
 to have blessed, than are birds and fishes. But as birds and fishes
 are said to be blessed, this should have been said, with much more
 reason, of the other animals as well.
"," Further, certain animals are generated from putrefaction,
 which is a kind of corruption. But corruption is repugnant to the
 first founding of the world. Therefore such animals should not have
 been produced at that time.
"," Further, certain animals are poisonous, and injurious to man.
 But there ought to have been nothing injurious to man before man
 sinned. Therefore such animals ought not to have been made by God at
 all, since He is the Author of good; or at least not until man had
 sinned.
",,," Certain things belong to the adornment of the universe
 by reason of their proper movement; and in this way the heavenly
 luminaries agree with others that conduce to that adornment, for they
 are moved by a living substance.
"," One being may be nobler than another absolutely, but
 not in a particular respect. While, then, it is not conceded that the
 souls of heavenly bodies are nobler than the souls of animals
 absolutely it must be conceded that they are superior to them with
 regard to their respective forms, since their form perfects their
 matter entirely, which is not in potentiality to other forms; whereas
 a soul does not do this. Also as regards movement the power that
 moves the heavenly bodies is of a nobler kind.
"," Since the heavenly body is a mover moved, it is of the
 nature of an instrument, which acts in virtue of the agent: and
 therefore since this agent is a living substance the heavenly body
 can impart life in virtue of that agent.
"," The movements of the heavenly bodies are natural, not
 on account of their active principle, but on account of their passive
 principle; that is to say, from a certain natural aptitude for being
 moved by an intelligent power.
"," The heaven is said to move itself in as far as it is
 compounded of mover and moved; not by the union of the mover, as the
 form, with the moved, as the matter, but by contact with the motive
 power, as we have said. So far, then, the principle that moves it may
 be called intrinsic, and consequently its movement natural with
 respect to that active principle; just as we say that voluntary
 movement is natural to the animal as animal (Phys. viii, text. 27).
"," It was laid down by Avicenna that animals of all kinds
 can be generated by various minglings of the elements, and naturally,
 without any kind of seed. This, however, seems repugnant to the fact
 that nature produces its effects by determinate means, and
 consequently, those things that are naturally generated from seed
 cannot be generated naturally in any other way. It ought, then,
 rather to be said that in the natural generation of all animals that
 are generated from seed, the active principle lies in the formative
 power of the seed, but that in the case of animals generated from
 putrefaction, the formative power of is the influence of the heavenly
 bodies. The material principle, however, in the generation of either
 kind of animals, is either some element, or something compounded of
 the elements. But at the first beginning of the world the active
 principle was the Word of God, which produced animals from material
 elements, either in act, as some holy writers say, or virtually, as
 Augustine teaches. Not as though the power possessed by water or
 earth of producing all animals resides in the earth and the water
 themselves, as Avicenna held, but in the power originally given to
 the elements of producing them from elemental matter by the power of
 seed or the influence of the stars.
"," The bodies of birds and fishes may be considered from
 two points of view. If considered in themselves, it will be evident
 that the earthly element must predominate, since the element that is
 least active, namely, the earth, must be the most abundant in
 quantity in order that the mingling may be duly tempered in the body
 of the animal. But if considered as by nature constituted to move
 with certain specific motions, thus they have some special affinity
 with the bodies in which they move; and hence the words in which
 their generation is described.
"," The air, as not being so apparent to the senses, is not
 enumerated by itself, but with other things: partly with the water,
 because the lower region of the air is thickened by watery
 exhalations; partly with the heaven as to the higher region. But
 birds move in the lower part of the air, and so are said to fly
 ""beneath the firmament,"" even if the firmament be taken to mean the
 region of clouds. Hence the production of birds is ascribed to the
 water.
"," Nature passes from one extreme to another through the
 medium; and therefore there are creatures of intermediate type
 between the animals of the air and those of the water, having
 something in common with both; and they are reckoned as belonging to
 that class to which they are most allied, through the characters
 possessed in common with that class, rather than with the other. But
 in order to include among fishes all such intermediate forms as have
 special characters like to theirs, the words, ""Let the waters bring
 forth the creeping creature having life,"" are followed by these: ""God
 created great whales,"" etc.
"," The order in which the production of these animals is
 given has reference to the order of those bodies which they are set
 to adorn, rather than to the superiority of the animals themselves.
 Moreover, in generation also the more perfect is reached through the
 less perfect.
"," The different grades of life which are found in
 different living creatures can be discovered from the various ways in
 which Scripture speaks of them, as Basil says (Hom. viii in Hexaem.).
 The life of plants, for instance, is very imperfect and difficult to
 discern, and hence, in speaking of their production, nothing is said
 of their life, but only their generation is mentioned, since only in
 generation is a vital act observed in them. For the powers of
 nutrition and growth are subordinate to the generative life, as will
 be shown later on (Q. 78, A. 2). But amongst animals, those that
 live on land are, generally speaking, more perfect than birds and
 fishes, not because the fish is devoid of memory, as Basil upholds
 (Hom. viii in Hexaem.) and Augustine rejects (Gen. ad lit. iii), but
 because their limbs are more distinct and their generation of a higher
 order, (yet some imperfect animals, such as bees and ants, are more
 intelligent in certain ways). Scripture, therefore, does not call
 fishes ""living creatures,"" but ""creeping creatures having life"";
 whereas it does call land animals ""living creatures"" on account of
 their more perfect life, and seems to imply that fishes are merely
 bodies having in them something of a soul, whilst land animals, from
 the higher perfection of their life, are, as it were, living souls
 with bodies subject to them. But the life of man, as being the most
 perfect grade, is not said to be produced, like the life of other
 animals, by earth or water, but immediately by God.
"," By ""cattle,"" domestic animals are signified, which in
 any way are of service to man: but by ""beasts,"" wild animals such as
 bears and lions are designated. By ""creeping things"" those animals
 are meant which either have no feet and cannot rise from the earth,
 as serpents, or those whose feet are too short to lift them far from
 the ground, as the lizard and tortoise. But since certain animals, as
 deer and goats, seem to fall under none of these classes, the word
 ""quadrupeds"" is added. Or perhaps the word ""quadruped"" is used first
 as being the genus, to which the others are added as species, for
 even some reptiles, such as lizards and tortoises, are four-footed.
"," In other animals, and in plants, mention is made of
 genus and species, to denote the generation of like from like. But it
 was unnecessary to do so in the case of man, as what had already been
 said of other creatures might be understood of him. Again, animals
 and plants may be said to be produced according to their kinds, to
 signify their remoteness from the Divine image and likeness, whereas
 man is said to be made ""to the image and likeness of God.""
"," The blessing of God gives power to multiply by
 generation, and, having been mentioned in the preceding account of
 the making of birds and fishes, could be understood of the beasts of
 the earth, without requiring to be repeated. The blessing, however,
 is repeated in the case of man, since in him generation of children
 has a special relation to the number of the elect [*Cf. Augustine,
 Gen. ad lit. iii, 12], and to prevent anyone from saying that there
 was any sin whatever in the act of begetting children. As to plants,
 since they experience neither desire of propagation, nor sensation
 in generating, they are deemed unworthy of a formal blessing.
"," Since the generation of one thing is the corruption of
 another, it was not incompatible with the first formation of things,
 that from the corruption of the less perfect the more perfect should
 be generated. Hence animals generated from the corruption of
 inanimate things, or of plants, may have been generated then. But
 those generated from corruption of animals could not have been
 produced then otherwise than potentially.
"," In the words of Augustine (Super. Gen. contr. Manich.
 i): ""If an unskilled person enters the workshop of an artificer he
 sees in it many appliances of which he does not understand the use,
 and which, if he is a foolish fellow, he considers unnecessary.
 Moreover, should he carelessly fall into the fire, or wound himself
 with a sharp-edged tool, he is under the impression that many of the
 things there are hurtful; whereas the craftsman, knowing their use,
 laughs at his folly. And thus some people presume to find fault with
 many things in this world, through not seeing the reasons for their
 existence. For though not required for the furnishing of our house,
 these things are necessary for the perfection of the universe."" And,
 since man before he sinned would have used the things of this world
 conformably to the order designed, poisonous animals would not have
 injured him.
"
353,"[I, Q. 73, Art. 1]
","Whether the Completion of the Divine Works Ought to Be Ascribed to
"," It would seem that the completion of the Divine works
 ought not to be ascribed to the seventh day. For all things that are
 done in this world belong to the Divine works. But the consummation
 of the world will be at the end of the world (Matt. 13:39, 40).
 Moreover, the time of Christ's Incarnation is a time of completion,
 wherefore it is called ""the time of fulness [*Vulg.: 'the fulness of
 time']"" (Gal. 4:4). And Christ Himself, at the moment of His death,
 cried out, ""It is consummated"" (John 19:30). Hence the completion of
 the Divine works does not belong to the seventh day.
"," Further, the completion of a work is an act in itself. But we
 do not read that God acted at all on the seventh day, but rather that
 He rested from all His work. Therefore the completion of the works
 does not belong to the seventh day.
"," Further, nothing is said to be complete to which many things
 are added, unless they are merely superfluous, for a thing is called
 perfect to which nothing is wanting that it ought to possess. But
 many things were made after the seventh day, as the production of
 many individual beings, and even of certain new species that are
 frequently appearing, especially in the case of animals generated
 from putrefaction. Also, God creates daily new souls. Again, the work
 of the Incarnation was a new work, of which it is said (Jer. 31:22):
 ""The Lord hath created a new thing upon the earth."" Miracles also are
 new works, of which it is said (Eccles. 36:6): ""Renew thy signs, and
 work new miracles."" Moreover, all things will be made new when the
 Saints are glorified, according to Apoc. 21:5: ""And He that sat on
 the throne said: Behold I make all things new."" Therefore the
 completion of the Divine works ought not to be attributed to the
 seventh day.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The first perfection is the cause of the second, as
 above said. Now for the attaining of beatitude two things are
 required, nature and grace. Therefore, as said above, the perfection
 of beatitude will be at the end of the world. But this consummation
 existed previously in its causes, as to nature, at the first founding
 of the world, as to grace, in the Incarnation of Christ. For, ""Grace
 and truth came by Jesus Christ"" (John 1:17). So, then, on the seventh
 day was the consummation of nature, in Christ's Incarnation the
 consummation of grace, and at the end of the world will be the
 consummation of glory.
"," God did act on the seventh day, not by creating new
 creatures, but by directing and moving His creatures to the work
 proper to them, and thus He made some beginning of the second
 perfection. So that, according to our version of the Scripture, the
 completion of the works is attributed to the seventh day, though
 according to another it is assigned to the sixth. Either version,
 however, may stand, since the completion of the universe as to the
 completeness of its parts belongs to the sixth day, but its
 completion as regards their operation, to the seventh. It may also be
 added that in continuous movement, so long as any movement further is
 possible, movement cannot be called completed till it comes to rest,
 for rest denotes consummation of movement. Now God might have made
 many other creatures besides those which He made in the six days, and
 hence, by the fact that He ceased making them on the seventh day, He
 is said on that day to have consummated His work.
"," Nothing entirely new was afterwards made by God, but
 all things subsequently made had in a sense been made before in the
 work of the six days. Some things, indeed, had a previous experience
 materially, as the rib from the side of Adam out of which God formed
 Eve; whilst others existed not only in matter but also in their
 causes, as those individual creatures that are now generated existed
 in the first of their kind. Species, also, that are new, if any such
 appear, existed beforehand in various active powers; so that animals,
 and perhaps even new species of animals, are produced by putrefaction
 by the power which the stars and elements received at the beginning.
 Again, animals of new kinds arise occasionally from the connection of
 individuals belonging to different species, as the mule is the
 offspring of an ass and a mare; but even these existed previously in
 their causes, in the works of the six days. Some also existed
 beforehand by way of similitude, as the souls now created. And the
 work of the Incarnation itself was thus foreshadowed, for as we read
 (Phil. 2:7), The Son of God ""was made in the likeness of men."" And
 again, the glory that is spiritual was anticipated in the angels by
 way of similitude; and that of the body in the heaven, especially the
 empyrean. Hence it is written (Eccles. 1:10), ""Nothing under the sun
 is new, for it hath already gone before, in the ages that were before
 us.""
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
354,"[I, Q. 73, Art. 2]
","Whether God Rested on the Seventh Day from All His Work?
"," It would seem that God did not rest on the seventh day
 from all His work. For it is said (John 5:17), ""My Father worketh until
 now, and I work."" God, then, did not rest on the seventh day from all
 His work.
"," Further, rest is opposed to movement, or to labor, which
 movement causes. But, as God produced His work without movement and
 without labor, He cannot be said to have rested on the seventh day
 from His work.
"," Further, should it be said that God rested on the seventh day
 by causing man to rest; against this it may be argued that rest is
 set down in contradistinction to His work; now the words ""God
 created"" or ""made"" this thing or the other cannot be explained to
 mean that He made man create or make these things. Therefore the
 resting of God cannot be explained as His making man to rest.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," God indeed ""worketh until now"" by preserving and
 providing for the creatures He has made, but not by the making of
 new ones.
"," Rest is here not opposed to labor or to movement, but
 to the production of new creatures, and to the desire tending to an
 external object.
"," Even as God rests in Himself alone and is happy in the
 enjoyment of Himself, so our own sole happiness lies in the enjoyment
 of God. Thus, also, He makes us find rest in Himself, both from His
 works and our own. It is not, then, unreasonable to say that God
 rested in giving rest to us. Still, this explanation must not be set
 down as the only one, and the other is the first and principal
 explanation.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
355,"[I, Q. 73, Art. 3]
","Whether Blessing and Sanctifying Are Due to the Seventh Day?
"," It would seem that blessing and sanctifying are not due
 to the seventh day. For it is usual to call a time blessed or holy for
 that some good thing has happened in it, or some evil been avoided.
 But whether God works or ceases from work nothing accrues to Him or is
 lost to Him. Therefore no special blessing or sanctifying are due to
 the seventh day.
"," Further, the Latin ""benedictio"" [blessing] is derived from
 ""bonitas"" [goodness]. But it is the nature of good to spread and
 communicate itself, as Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv). The days,
 therefore, in which God produced creatures deserved a blessing rather
 than the day on which He ceased producing them.
"," Further, over each creature a blessing was pronounced, as
 upon each work it was said, ""God saw that it was good."" Therefore it
 was not necessary that after all had been produced, the seventh day
 should be blessed.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The seventh day is said to be sanctified not because
 anything can accrue to God, or be taken from Him, but because
 something is added to creatures by their multiplying, and by their
 resting in God.
"," In the first six days creatures were produced in their
 first causes, but after being thus produced, they are multiplied and
 preserved, and this work also belongs to the Divine goodness. And the
 perfection of this goodness is made most clear by the knowledge that
 in it alone God finds His own rest, and we may find ours in its
 fruition.
"," The good mentioned in the works of each day belongs to
 the first institution of nature; but the blessing attached to the
 seventh day, to its propagation.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
356,"[I, Q. 74, Art. 1]
","Whether these days are sufficiently enumerated?
"," It would seem that these days are not sufficiently
 enumerated. For the work of creation is no less distinct from the
 works of distinction and adornment than these two works are from one
 another. But separate days are assigned to distinction and to
 adornment, and therefore separate days should be assigned to creation.
"," Further, air and fire are nobler elements than earth and
 water. But one day is assigned to the distinction of water, and
 another to the distinction of the land. Therefore, other days ought
 to be devoted to the distinction of fire and air.
"," Further, fish differ from birds as much as birds differ from
 the beasts of the earth, whereas man differs more from other animals
 than all animals whatsoever differ from each other. But one day is
 devoted to the production of fishes, and another to that of the beast
 of the earth. Another day, then, ought to be assigned to the
 production of birds and another to that of man.
"," Further, it would seem, on the other hand, that some of these
 days are superfluous. Light, for instance, stands to the luminaries
 in the relation of accident to subject. But the subject is produced
 at the same time as the accident proper to it. The light and the
 luminaries, therefore, ought not to have been produced on different
 days.
"," Further, these days are devoted to the first instituting of
 the world. But as on the seventh day nothing was instituted, that day
 ought not to be enumerated with the others.
",,,,,,,,,,,,," According to Augustine, the work of creation belongs
 to the production of formless matter, and of the formless spiritual
 nature, both of which are outside of time, as he himself says
 (Confess. xii, 12). Thus, then, the creation of either is set down
 before there was any day. But it may also be said, following other
 holy writers, that the works of distinction and adornment imply
 certain changes in the creature which are measurable by time; whereas
 the work of creation lies only in the Divine act producing the
 substance of beings instantaneously. For this reason, therefore,
 every work of distinction and adornment is said to take place ""in a
 day,"" but creation ""in the beginning"" which denotes something
 indivisible.
"," Fire and air, as not distinctly known by the
 unlettered, are not expressly named by Moses among the parts of the
 world, but reckoned with the intermediate part, or water, especially
 as regards the lowest part of the air; or with the heaven, to which
 the higher region of air approaches, as Augustine says (Gen. ad lit.
 ii, 13).
"," The production of animals is recorded with reference to
 their adorning the various parts of the world, and therefore the days
 of their production are separated or united according as the animals
 adorn the same parts of the world, or different parts.
"," The nature of light, as existing in a subject, was made
 on the first day; and the making of the luminaries on the fourth day
 does not mean that their substance was produced anew, but that they
 then received a form that they had not before, as said above (Q. 70,
 [A. 1] ad 2).
"," According to Augustine (Gen. ad lit. iv, 15), after all
 that has been recorded that is assigned to the six days, something
 distinct is attributed to the seventh--namely, that on it God rested
 in Himself from His works: and for this reason it was right that the
 seventh day should be mentioned after the six. It may also be said,
 with the other writers, that the world entered on the seventh day
 upon a new state, in that nothing new was to be added to it, and that
 therefore the seventh day is mentioned after the six, from its being
 devoted to cessation from work.
",,,,,,,,,,,
357,"[I, Q. 74, Art. 2]
","Whether All These Days Are One Day?
"," It would seem that all these days are one day. For it is
 written (Gen. 2:4, 5): ""These are the generations of the heaven and
 the earth, when they were created, in the day that the Lord . . .
 made the heaven and the earth, and every plant of the field, before
 it sprung up in the earth."" Therefore the day in which God made ""the
 heaven and the earth, and every plant of the field,"" is one and the
 same day. But He made the heaven and the earth on the first day, or
 rather before there was any day, but the plant of the field He made
 on the third day. Therefore the first and third days are but one day,
 and for a like reason all the rest.
"," Further, it is said (Ecclus. 18:1): ""He that liveth for ever,
 created all things together."" But this would not be the case if the
 days of these works were more than one. Therefore they are not many
 but one only.
"," Further, on the seventh day God ceased from all new works.
 If, then, the seventh day is distinct from the other days, it follows
 that He did not make that day; which is not admissible.
"," Further, the entire work ascribed to one day God perfected in
 an instant, for with each work are the words (God) ""said . . . . and
 it was . . . done."" If, then, He had kept back His next work to
 another day, it would follow that for the remainder of a day He would
 have ceased from working and left it vacant, which would be
 superfluous. The day, therefore, of the preceding work is one with
 the day of the work that follows.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," On the day on which God created the heaven and the
 earth, He created also every plant of the field, not, indeed,
 actually, but ""before it sprung up in the earth,"" that is,
 potentially. And this work Augustine ascribes to the third day,
 but other writers to the first instituting of the world.
"," God created all things together so far as regards their
 substance in some measure formless. But He did not create all things
 together, so far as regards that formation of things which lies in
 distinction and adornment. Hence the word ""creation"" is significant.
"," On the seventh day God ceased from making new things,
 but not from providing for their increase, and to this latter work it
 belongs that the first day is succeeded by other days.
"," All things were not distinguished and adorned together,
 not from a want of power on God's part, as requiring time in which to
 work, but that due order might be observed in the instituting of the
 world. Hence it was fitting that different days should be assigned to
 the different states of the world, as each succeeding work added to
 the world a fresh state of perfection.
"," According to Augustine, the order of days refers to the
 natural order of the works attributed to the days.
",,,,,,,,,,,
358,"[I, Q. 74, Art. 3]
","Whether Scripture Uses Suitable Words to Express the Work of the Six
"," It would seem the Scripture does not use suitable words
 to express the works of the six days. For as light, the firmament,
 and other similar works were made by the Word of God, so were the
 heaven and the earth. For ""all things were made by Him"" (John 1:3).
 Therefore in the creation of heaven and earth, as in the other works,
 mention should have been made of the Word of God.
"," Further, the water was created by God, yet its creation is
 not mentioned. Therefore the creation of the world is not
 sufficiently described.
"," Further, it is said (Gen. 1:31): ""God saw all the things that
 He had made, and they were very good."" It ought, then, to have been
 said of each work, ""God saw that it was good."" The omission,
 therefore, of these words in the work of creation and in that of the
 second day, is not fitting.
"," Further, the Spirit of God is God Himself. But it does not
 befit God to move and to occupy place. Therefore the words, ""The
 Spirit of God moved over the waters,"" are unbecoming.
"," Further, what is already made is not made over again.
 Therefore to the words, ""God said: Let the firmament be made . . .
 and it was so,"" it is superfluous to add, ""God made the firmament.""
 And the like is to be said of other works.
"," Further, evening and morning do not sufficiently divide the
 day, since the day has many parts. Therefore the words, ""The evening
 and morning were the second day"" or, ""the third day,"" are not
 suitable.
"," Further, ""first,"" not ""one,"" corresponds to ""second"" and
 ""third."" It should therefore have been said that, ""The evening and
 the morning were the first day,"" rather than ""one day.""
",,,,,,,,,,," According to Augustine (Gen. ad lit. i, 4), the person
 of the Son is mentioned both in the first creation of the world, and
 in its distinction and adornment, but differently in either place.
 For distinction and adornment belong to the work by which the world
 receives its form. But as the giving form to a work of art is by
 means of the form of the art in the mind of the artist, which may be
 called his intelligible word, so the giving form to every creature is
 by the word of God; and for this reason in the works of distinction
 and adornment the Word is mentioned. But in creation the Son is
 mentioned as the beginning, by the words, ""In the beginning God
 created,"" since by creation is understood the production of formless
 matter. But according to those who hold that the elements were
 created from the first under their proper forms, another explanation
 must be given; and therefore Basil says (Hom. ii, iii in Hexaem.)
 that the words, ""God said,"" signify a Divine command. Such a command,
 however, could not have been given before creatures had been produced
 that could obey it.
"," According to Augustine (De Civ. Dei ix, 33), by the
 heaven is understood the formless spiritual nature, and by the earth,
 the formless matter of all corporeal things, and thus no creature is
 omitted. But, according to Basil (Hom. i in Hexaem.), the heaven and
 the earth, as the two extremes, are alone mentioned, the intervening
 things being left to be understood, since all these move heavenwards,
 if light, or earthwards, if heavy. And others say that under the
 word, ""earth,"" Scripture is accustomed to include all the four
 elements as (Ps. 148:7,8) after the words, ""Praise the Lord from the
 earth,"" is added, ""fire, hail, snow, and ice.""
"," In the account of the creation there is found something
 to correspond to the words, ""God saw that it was good,"" used in the
 work of distinction and adornment, and this appears from the
 consideration that the Holy Spirit is Love. Now, ""there are two
 things,"" says Augustine (Gen. ad lit. i, 8) which came from God's
 love of His creatures, their existence and their permanence. That
 they might then exist, and exist permanently, ""the Spirit of God,"" it
 is said, ""moved over the waters""--that is to say, over that formless
 matter, signified by water, even as the love of the artist moves over
 the materials of his art, that out of them he may form his work. And
 the words, ""God saw that it was good,"" signify that the things that
 He had made were to endure, since they express a certain satisfaction
 taken by God in His works, as of an artist in his art: not as though
 He knew the creature otherwise, or that the creature was pleasing to
 Him otherwise, than before He made it. Thus in either work, of
 creation and of formation, the Trinity of Persons is implied. In
 creation the Person of the Father is indicated by God the Creator,
 the Person of the Son by the beginning, in which He created, and the
 Person of the Holy Ghost by the Spirit that moved over the waters.
 But in the formation, the Person of the Father is indicated by God
 that speaks, and the Person of the Son by the Word in which He
 speaks, and the Person of the Holy Spirit by the satisfaction with
 which God saw that what was made was good. And if the words, ""God saw
 that it was good,"" are not said of the work of the second day, this
 is because the work of distinguishing the waters was only begun on
 that day, but perfected on the third. Hence these words, that are
 said of the third day, refer also to the second. Or it may be that
 Scripture does not use these words of approval of the second day's
 work, because this is concerned with the distinction of things not
 evident to the senses of mankind. Or, again, because by the firmament
 is simply understood the cloudy region of the air, which is not one
 of the permanent parts of the universe, nor of the principal
 divisions of the world. The above three reasons are given by Rabbi
 Moses [*Perplex. ii.], and to these may be added a mystical one
 derived from numbers and assigned by some writers, according to whom
 the work of the second day is not marked with approval because the
 second number is an imperfect number, as receding from the perfection
 of unity.
"," Rabbi Moses (Perplex. ii) understands by the ""Spirit of
 the Lord,"" the air or the wind, as Plato also did, and says that it
 is so called according to the custom of Scripture, in which these
 things are throughout attributed to God. But according to the holy
 writers, the Spirit of the Lord signifies the Holy Ghost, Who is said
 to ""move over the water""--that is to say, over what Augustine holds
 to mean formless matter, lest it should be supposed that God loved of
 necessity the works He was to produce, as though He stood in need of
 them. For love of that kind is subject to, not superior to, the
 object of love. Moreover, it is fittingly implied that the Spirit
 moved over that which was incomplete and unfinished, since that
 movement is not one of place, but of pre-eminent power, as Augustine
 says (Gen. ad lit. i, 7). It is the opinion, however, of Basil (Hom.
 ii in Hexaem.) that the Spirit moved over the element of water,
 ""fostering and quickening its nature and impressing vital power, as
 the hen broods over her chickens."" For water has especially a
 life-giving power, since many animals are generated in water, and the
 seed of all animals is liquid. Also the life of the soul is given by
 the water of baptism, according to John 3:5: ""Unless a man be born
 again of water and the Holy Ghost, he cannot enter into the kingdom
 of God.""
"," According to Augustine (Gen. ad lit. i, 8), these three
 phrases denote the threefold being of creatures; first, their being
 in the Word, denoted by the command ""Let . . . be made""; secondly,
 their being in the angelic mind, signified by the words, ""It was . .
 . done""; thirdly, their being in their proper nature, by the words,
 ""He made."" And because the formation of the angels is recorded on the
 first day, it was not necessary there to add, ""He made."" It may also
 be said, following other writers, that the words, ""He said,"" and ""Let
 . . . be made,"" denote God's command, and the words, ""It was done,""
 the fulfilment of that command. But as it was necessary, for the sake
 of those especially who have asserted that all visible things were
 made by the angels, to mention how things were made, it is added, in
 order to remove that error, that God Himself made them. Hence, in
 each work, after the words, ""It was done,"" some act of God is
 expressed by some such words as, ""He made,"" or, ""He divided,"" or,
 ""He called.""
"," According to Augustine (Gen. ad lit. iv, 22, 30), by
 the ""evening"" and the ""morning"" are understood the evening and the
 morning knowledge of the angels, which has been explained (Q. 58,
 A. 6, 7). But, according to Basil (Hom. ii in Hexaem.), the entire
 period takes its name, as is customary, from its more important part,
 the day. An instance of this is found in the words of Jacob, ""The
 days of my pilgrimage,"" where night is not mentioned at all. But the
 evening and the morning are mentioned as being the ends of the day,
 since day begins with morning and ends with evening, or because
 evening denotes the beginning of night, and morning the beginning of
 day. It seems fitting, also, that where the first distinction of
 creatures is described, divisions of time should be denoted only by
 what marks their beginning. And the reason for mentioning the evening
 first is that as the evening ends the day, which begins with the
 light, the termination of the light at evening precedes the
 termination of the darkness, which ends with the morning. But
 Chrysostom's explanation is that thereby it is intended to show that
 the natural day does not end with the evening, but with the morning
 (Hom. v in Gen.).
"," The words ""one day"" are used when day is first
 instituted, to denote that one day is made up of twenty-four hours.
 Hence, by mentioning ""one,"" the measure of a natural day is fixed.
 Another reason may be to signify that a day is completed by the
 return of the sun to the point from which it commenced its course.
 And yet another, because at the completion of a week of seven days,
 the first day returns which is one with the eighth day. The three
 reasons assigned above are those given by Basil (Hom. ii in Hexaem.).

","Whether the Soul Is a Body?
"," It would seem that the soul is a body. For the soul is
 the moving principle of the body. Nor does it move unless moved.
 First, because seemingly nothing can move unless it is itself moved,
 since nothing gives what it has not; for instance, what is not hot
 does not give heat. Secondly, because if there be anything that moves
 and is not moved, it must be the cause of eternal, unchanging
 movement, as we find proved Phys. viii, 6; and this does not appear to
 be the case in the movement of an animal, which is caused by the soul.
 Therefore the soul is a mover moved. But every mover moved is a body.
 Therefore the soul is a body.
"," Further, all knowledge is caused by means of a likeness.
 But there can be no likeness of a body to an incorporeal thing. If,
 therefore, the soul were not a body, it could not have knowledge of
 corporeal things.
"," Further, between the mover and the moved there must be
 contact. But contact is only between bodies. Since, therefore, the
 soul moves the body, it seems that the soul must be a body.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," As everything which is in motion must be moved by
 something else, a process which cannot be prolonged indefinitely, we
 must allow that not every mover is moved. For, since to be moved is
 to pass from potentiality to actuality, the mover gives what it has
 to the thing moved, inasmuch as it causes it to be in act. But, as
 is shown in Phys. viii, 6, there is a mover which is altogether
 immovable, and not moved either essentially, or accidentally; and
 such a mover can cause an invariable movement. There is, however,
 another kind of mover, which, though not moved essentially, is moved
 accidentally; and for this reason it does not cause an invariable
 movement; such a mover, is the soul. There is, again, another mover,
 which is moved essentially--namely, the body. And because the
 philosophers of old believed that nothing existed but bodies, they
 maintained that every mover is moved; and that the soul is moved
 directly, and is a body.
"," The likeness of a thing known is not of necessity
 actually in the nature of the knower; but given a thing which knows
 potentially, and afterwards knows actually, the likeness of the thing
 known must be in the nature of the knower, not actually, but only
 potentially; thus color is not actually in the pupil of the eye, but
 only potentially. Hence it is necessary, not that the likeness of
 corporeal things should be actually in the nature of the soul, but
 that there be a potentiality in the soul for such a likeness. But the
 ancient philosophers omitted to distinguish between actuality and
 potentiality; and so they held that the soul must be a body in order
 to have knowledge of a body; and that it must be composed of the
 principles of which all bodies are formed in order to know all bodies.
"," There are two kinds of contact; of ""quantity,"" and of
 ""power."" By the former a body can be touched only by a body; by the
 latter a body can be touched by an incorporeal thing, which moves
 that body.

360,"[I, Q. 75, Art. 2]
","Whether the Human Soul Is Something Subsistent?
"," It would seem that the human soul is not something
 subsistent. For that which subsists is said to be ""this particular
 thing."" Now ""this particular thing"" is said not of the soul, but of
 that which is composed of soul and body. Therefore the soul is not
 something subsistent.
"," Further, everything subsistent operates. But the soul does
 not operate; for, as the Philosopher says (De Anima i, 4), ""to say
 that the soul feels or understands is like saying that the soul
 weaves or builds."" Therefore the soul is not subsistent.
"," Further, if the soul were subsistent, it would have some
 operation apart from the body. But it has no operation apart from the
 body, not even that of understanding: for the act of understanding
 does not take place without a phantasm, which cannot exist apart from
 the body. Therefore the human soul is not something subsistent.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," ""This particular thing"" can be taken in two senses.
 Firstly, for anything subsistent; secondly, for that which subsists,
 and is complete in a specific nature. The former sense excludes the
 inherence of an accident or of a material form; the latter excludes
 also the imperfection of the part, so that a hand can be called ""this
 particular thing"" in the first sense, but not in the second.
 Therefore, as the human soul is a part of human nature, it can indeed
 be called ""this particular thing,"" in the first sense, as being
 something subsistent; but not in the second, for in this sense, what
 is composed of body and soul is said to be ""this particular thing.""
"," Aristotle wrote those words as expressing not his own
 opinion, but the opinion of those who said that to understand is to
 be moved, as is clear from the context. Or we may reply that to
 operate per se belongs to what exists per se. But for a thing to
 exist per se, it suffices sometimes that it be not inherent, as an
 accident or a material form; even though it be part of something.
 Nevertheless, that is rightly said to subsist per se, which is
 neither inherent in the above sense, nor part of anything else. In
 this sense, the eye or the hand cannot be said to subsist per se;
 nor can it for that reason be said to operate per se. Hence the
 operation of the parts is through each part attributed to the whole.
 For we say that man sees with the eye, and feels with the hand, and
 not in the same sense as when we say that what is hot gives heat by
 its heat; for heat, strictly speaking, does not give heat. We may
 therefore say that the soul understands, as the eye sees; but it is
 more correct to say that man understands through the soul.
"," The body is necessary for the action of the intellect,
 not as its origin of action, but on the part of the object; for the
 phantasm is to the intellect what color is to the sight. Neither
 does such a dependence on the body prove the intellect to be
 non-subsistent; otherwise it would follow that an animal is
 non-subsistent, since it requires external objects of the senses
 in order to perform its act of perception.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
361,"[I, Q. 75, Art. 3]
","Whether the Souls of Brute Animals Are Subsistent?
"," It would seem that the souls of brute animals are
 subsistent. For man is of the same genus as other animals; and,
 as we have just shown (A. 2), the soul of man is subsistent.
 Therefore the souls of other animals are subsistent.
"," Further, the relation of the sensitive faculty to sensible
 objects is like the relation of the intellectual faculty to
 intelligible objects. But the intellect, apart from the body,
 apprehends intelligible objects. Therefore the sensitive faculty,
 apart from the body, perceives sensible objects. Therefore, since
 the souls of brute animals are sensitive, it follows that they are
 subsistent; just as the human intellectual soul is subsistent.
"," Further, the soul of brute animals moves the body. But the
 body is not a mover, but is moved. Therefore the soul of brute
 animals has an operation apart from the body.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Although man is of the same genus as other animals, he
 is of a different species. Specific difference is derived from the
 difference of form; nor does every difference of form necessarily
 imply a diversity of genus.
"," The relation of the sensitive faculty to the sensible
 object is in one way the same as that of the intellectual faculty to
 the intelligible object, in so far as each is in potentiality to its
 object. But in another way their relations differ, inasmuch as the
 impression of the object on the sense is accompanied with change in
 the body; so that excessive strength of the sensible corrupts sense;
 a thing that never occurs in the case of the intellect. For an
 intellect that understands the highest of intelligible objects is
 more able afterwards to understand those that are lower. If, however,
 in the process of intellectual operation the body is weary, this
 result is accidental, inasmuch as the intellect requires the
 operation of the sensitive powers in the production of the phantasms.
"," Motive power is of two kinds. One, the appetitive
 power, commands motion. The operation of this power in the sensitive
 soul is not apart from the body; for anger, joy, and passions of a
 like nature are accompanied by a change in the body. The other motive
 power is that which executes motion in adapting the members for
 obeying the appetite; and the act of this power does not consist in
 moving, but in being moved. Whence it is clear that to move is not an
 act of the sensitive soul without the body.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
362,"[I, Q. 75, Art. 4]
","Whether the Soul Is Man?
"," It would seem that the soul is man. For it is written (2
 Cor. 4:16): ""Though our outward man is corrupted, yet the inward man
 is renewed day by day."" But that which is within man is the soul.
 Therefore the soul is the inward man.
"," Further, the human soul is a substance. But it is not a
 universal substance. Therefore it is a particular substance. Therefore
 it is a ""hypostasis"" or a person; and it can only be a human person.
 Therefore the soul is man; for a human person is a man.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,," According to the Philosopher (Ethic. ix, 8), a thing
 seems to be chiefly what is princip[al] in it; thus what the governor
 of a state does, the state is said to do. In this way sometimes what
 is princip[al] in man is said to be man; sometimes, indeed, the
 intellectual part which, in accordance with truth, is called the
 ""inward"" man; and sometimes the sensitive part with the body is
 called man in the opinion of those whose observation does not go
 beyond the senses. And this is called the ""outward"" man.
"," Not every particular substance is a hypostasis or a
 person, but that which has the complete nature of its species. Hence
 a hand, or a foot, is not called a hypostasis, or a person; nor,
 likewise, is the soul alone so called, since it is a part of the
 human species.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
363,"[I, Q. 75, Art. 5]
","Whether the Soul Is Composed of Matter and Form?
"," It would seem that the soul is composed of matter and
 form. For potentiality is opposed to actuality. Now, whatsoever
 things are in actuality participate of the First Act, which is God;
 by participation of Whom, all things are good, are beings, and are
 living things, as is clear from the teaching of Dionysius (Div. Nom.
 v). Therefore whatsoever things are in potentiality participate of
 the first potentiality. But the first potentiality is primary matter.
 Therefore, since the human soul is, after a manner, in potentiality;
 which appears from the fact that sometimes a man is potentially
 understanding; it seems that the human soul must participate of
 primary matter, as part of itself.
"," Further, wherever the properties of matter are found, there
 matter is. But the properties of matter are found in the
 soul--namely, to be a subject, and to be changed, for it is a subject
 to science, and virtue; and it changes from ignorance to knowledge
 and from vice to virtue. Therefore matter is in the soul.
"," Further, things which have no matter, have no cause of their
 existence, as the Philosopher says Metaph. viii (Did. vii, 6). But
 the soul has a cause of its existence, since it is created by God.
 Therefore the soul has matter.
"," Further, what has no matter, and is a form only, is a pure
 act, and is infinite. But this belongs to God alone. Therefore the
 soul has matter.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," The First Act is the universal principle of all acts;
 because It is infinite, virtually ""precontaining all things,"" as
 Dionysius says (Div. Nom. v). Wherefore things participate of It not
 as a part of themselves, but by diffusion of Its processions. Now as
 potentiality is receptive of act, it must be proportionate to act.
 But the acts received which proceed from the First Infinite Act, and
 are participations thereof, are diverse, so that there cannot be one
 potentiality which receives all acts, as there is one act, from which
 all participated acts are derived; for then the receptive
 potentiality would equal the active potentiality of the First Act.
 Now the receptive potentiality in the intellectual soul is other than
 the receptive potentiality of first matter, as appears from the
 diversity of the things received by each. For primary matter receives
 individual forms; whereas the intelligence receives absolute forms.
 Hence the existence of such a potentiality in the intellectual soul
 does not prove that the soul is composed of matter and form.
"," To be a subject and to be changed belong to matter by
 reason of its being in potentiality. As, therefore, the potentiality
 of the intelligence is one thing and the potentiality of primary
 matter another, so in each is there a different reason of subjection
 and change. For the intelligence is subject to knowledge, and is
 changed from ignorance to knowledge, by reason of its being in
 potentiality with regard to the intelligible species.
"," The form causes matter to be, and so does the agent;
 wherefore the agent causes matter to be, so far as it actualizes it
 by transmuting it to the act of a form. A subsistent form, however,
 does not owe its existence to some formal principle, nor has it a
 cause transmuting it from potentiality to act. So after the words
 quoted above, the Philosopher concludes, that in things composed of
 matter and form ""there is no other cause but that which moves from
 potentiality to act; while whatsoever things have no matter are
 simply beings at once."" [*The Leonine edition has, ""simpliciter sunt
 quod vere entia aliquid."" The Parma edition of St. Thomas's
 Commentary on Aristotle has, ""statim per se unum quiddam est . . .
 et ens quiddam.""]
"," Everything participated is compared to the participator
 as its act. But whatever created form be supposed to subsist ""per
 se,"" must have existence by participation; for ""even life,"" or
 anything of that sort, ""is a participator of existence,"" as Dionysius
 says (Div. Nom. v). Now participated existence is limited by the
 capacity of the participator; so that God alone, Who is His own
 existence, is pure act and infinite. But in intellectual substances
 there is composition of actuality and potentiality, not, indeed, of
 matter and form, but of form and participated existence. Wherefore
 some say that they are composed of that ""whereby they are"" and that
 ""which they are""; for existence itself is that by which a thing is.

364,"[I, Q. 75, Art. 6]
","Whether the Human Soul Is Incorruptible?
"," It would seem that the human soul is corruptible. For
 those things that have a like beginning and process seemingly have a
 like end. But the beginning, by generation, of men is like that of
 animals, for they are made from the earth. And the process of life is
 alike in both; because ""all things breathe alike, and man hath nothing
 more than the beast,"" as it is written (Eccles. 3:19). Therefore, as
 the same text concludes, ""the death of man and beast is one, and the
 condition of both is equal."" But the souls of brute animals are
 corruptible. Therefore, also, the human soul is corruptible.
"," Further, whatever is out of nothing can return to
 nothingness; because the end should correspond to the beginning. But
 as it is written (Wis. 2:2), ""We are born of nothing""; which is true,
 not only of the body, but also of the soul. Therefore, as is
 concluded in the same passage, ""After this we shall be as if we had
 not been,"" even as to our soul.
"," Further, nothing is without its own proper operation. But the
 operation proper to the soul, which is to understand through a
 phantasm, cannot be without the body. For the soul understands
 nothing without a phantasm; and there is no phantasm without the body
 as the Philosopher says (De Anima i, 1). Therefore the soul cannot
 survive the dissolution of the body.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Solomon reasons thus in the person of the foolish, as
 expressed in the words of Wisdom 2. Therefore the saying that man and
 animals have a like beginning in generation is true of the body; for
 all animals alike are made of earth. But it is not true of the soul.
 For the souls of brutes are produced by some power of the body;
 whereas the human soul is produced by God. To signify this it is
 written as to other animals: ""Let the earth bring forth the living
 soul"" (Gen. 1:24): while of man it is written (Gen. 2:7) that ""He
 breathed into his face the breath of life."" And so in the last
 chapter of Ecclesiastes (12:7) it is concluded: ""(Before) the dust
 return into its earth from whence it was; and the spirit return to
 God Who gave it."" Again the process of life is alike as to the body,
 concerning which it is written (Eccles. 3:19): ""All things breathe
 alike,"" and (Wis. 2:2), ""The breath in our nostrils is smoke."" But
 the process is not alike of the soul; for man is intelligent, whereas
 animals are not. Hence it is false to say: ""Man has nothing more than
 beasts."" Thus death comes to both alike as to the body, by not as to
 the soul.
"," As a thing can be created by reason, not of a passive
 potentiality, but only of the active potentiality of the Creator, Who
 can produce something out of nothing, so when we say that a thing can
 be reduced to nothing, we do not imply in the creature a potentiality
 to non-existence, but in the Creator the power of ceasing to sustain
 existence. But a thing is said to be corruptible because there is in
 it a potentiality to non-existence.
"," To understand through a phantasm is the proper
 operation of the soul by virtue of its union with the body. After
 separation from the body it will have another mode of understanding,
 similar to other substances separated from bodies, as will appear
 later on (Q. 89, A. 1).
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
365,"[I, Q. 75, Art. 7]
","Whether the Soul Is of the Same Species As an Angel?
"," It would seem that the soul is of the same species as an
 angel. For each thing is ordained to its proper end by the nature of
 its species, whence is derived its inclination for that end. But the
 end of the soul is the same as that of an angel--namely, eternal
 happiness. Therefore they are of the same species.
"," Further, the ultimate specific difference is the noblest,
 because it completes the nature of the species. But there is nothing
 nobler either in an angel or in the soul than their intellectual
 nature. Therefore the soul and the angel agree in the ultimate
 specific difference: therefore they belong to the same species.
"," Further, it seems that the soul does not differ from an angel
 except in its union with the body. But as the body is outside the
 essence of the soul, it seems that it does not belong to its species.
 Therefore the soul and angel are of the same species.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," This argument proceeds from the proximate and natural
 end. Eternal happiness is the ultimate and supernatural end.
"," The ultimate specific difference is the noblest because
 it is the most determinate, in the same way as actuality is nobler
 than potentiality. Thus, however, the intellectual faculty is not the
 noblest, because it is indeterminate and common to many degrees of
 intellectuality; as the sensible faculty is common to many degrees in
 the sensible nature. Hence, as all sensible things are not of one
 species, so neither are all intellectual things of one species.
"," The body is not of the essence of the soul; but the
 soul by the nature of its essence can be united to the body, so that,
 properly speaking, not the soul alone, but the ""composite,"" is the
 species. And the very fact that the soul in a certain way requires
 the body for its operation, proves that the soul is endowed with a
 grade of intellectuality inferior to that of an angel, who is not
 united to a body.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
366,"[I, Q. 76, Art. 1]
","Whether the Intellectual Principle Is United to the Body As Its Form?
"," It seems that the intellectual principle is not united to
 the body as its form. For the Philosopher says (De Anima iii, 4) that
 the intellect is ""separate,"" and that it is not the act of any body.
 Therefore it is not united to the body as its form.
"," Further, every form is determined according to the nature
 of the matter of which it is the form; otherwise no proportion would
 be required between matter and form. Therefore if the intellect were
 united to the body as its form, since every body has a determinate
 nature, it would follow that the intellect has a determinate nature;
 and thus, it would not be capable of knowing all things, as is clear
 from what has been said (Q. 75, A. 2); which is contrary to the
 nature of the intellect. Therefore the intellect is not united to
 the body as its form.
"," Further, whatever receptive power is an act of a body,
 receives a form materially and individually; for what is received must
 be received according to the condition of the receiver. But the form
 of the thing understood is not received into the intellect materially
 and individually, but rather immaterially and universally: otherwise
 the intellect would not be capable of the knowledge of immaterial and
 universal objects, but only of individuals, like the senses. Therefore
 the intellect is not united to the body as its form.
"," Further, power and action have the same subject; for the same
 subject is what can, and does, act. But the intellectual action is
 not the action of a body, as appears from above (Q. 75, A. 2).
 Therefore neither is the intellectual faculty a power of the body.
 But virtue or power cannot be more abstract or more simple than the
 essence from which the faculty or power is derived. Therefore neither
 is the substance of the intellect the form of a body.
"," Further, whatever has per se existence is not united to the
 body as its form; because a form is that by which a thing exists: so
 that the very existence of a form does not belong to the form by
 itself. But the intellectual principle has per se existence and is
 subsistent, as was said above (Q. 75, A. 2). Therefore it is not
 united to the body as its form.
"," Further, whatever exists in a thing by reason of its nature
 exists in it always. But to be united to matter belongs to the form
 by reason of its nature; because form is the act of matter, not by an
 accidental quality, but by its own essence; otherwise matter and form
 would not make a thing substantially one, but only accidentally one.
 Therefore a form cannot be without its own proper matter. But the
 intellectual principle, since it is incorruptible, as was shown above
 (Q. 75, A. 6), remains separate from the body, after the dissolution
 of the body. Therefore the intellectual principle is not united to
 the body as its form.
",,,,,,,,,,,," As the Philosopher says (Phys. ii, 2), the ultimate
 natural form to which the consideration of the natural philosopher is
 directed is indeed separate; yet it exists in matter. He proves this
 from the fact that ""man and the sun generate man from matter."" It is
 separate indeed according to its intellectual power, because the
 intellectual power does not belong to a corporeal organ, as the power
 of seeing is the act of the eye; for understanding is an act which
 cannot be performed by a corporeal organ, like the act of seeing. But
 it exists in matter so far as the soul itself, to which this power
 belongs, is the form of the body, and the term of human generation.
 And so the Philosopher says (De Anima iii) that the intellect is
 separate, because it is not the faculty of a corporeal organ.
"," The human soul, by reason of its perfection, is not a
 form merged in matter, or entirely embraced by matter. Therefore
 there is nothing to prevent some power thereof not being the act of
 the body, although the soul is essentially the form of the body.
"," The soul communicates that existence in which it
 subsists to the corporeal matter, out of which and the intellectual
 soul there results unity of existence; so that the existence of the
 whole composite is also the existence of the soul. This is not the
 case with other non-subsistent forms. For this reason the human soul
 retains its own existence after the dissolution of the body; whereas
 it is not so with other forms.
"," To be united to the body belongs to the soul by reason
 of itself, as it belongs to a light body by reason of itself to be
 raised up. And as a light body remains light, when removed from its
 proper place, retaining meanwhile an aptitude and an inclination for
 its proper place; so the human soul retains its proper existence when
 separated from the body, having an aptitude and a natural inclination
 to be united to the body.
",,,,,,,,,,,,
367,"[I, Q. 76, Art. 2]
","Whether the Intellectual Principle Is Multiplied According to the
"," It would seem that the intellectual principle is not
 multiplied according to the number of bodies, but that there is one
 intellect in all men. For an immaterial substance is not multiplied
 in number within one species. But the human soul is an immaterial
 substance; since it is not composed of matter and form as was shown
 above (Q. 75, A. 5). Therefore there are not many human souls in
 one species. But all men are of one species. Therefore there is but
 one intellect in all men.
"," Further, when the cause is removed, the effect is also
 removed. Therefore, if human souls were multiplied according to the
 number of bodies, it follows that the bodies being removed, the number
 of souls would not remain; but from all the souls there would be but a
 single remainder. This is heretical; for it would do away with the
 distinction of rewards and punishments.
"," Further, if my intellect is distinct from your intellect, my
 intellect is an individual, and so is yours; for individuals are
 things which differ in number but agree in one species. Now whatever
 is received into anything must be received according to the condition
 of the receiver. Therefore the species of things would be received
 individually into my intellect, and also into yours: which is
 contrary to the nature of the intellect which knows universals.
"," Further, the thing understood is in the intellect which
 understands. If, therefore, my intellect is distinct from yours, what
 is understood by me must be distinct from what is understood by you;
 and consequently it will be reckoned as something individual, and be
 only potentially something understood; so that the common intention
 will have to be abstracted from both; since from things diverse
 something intelligible common to them may be abstracted. But this is
 contrary to the nature of the intellect; for then the intellect would
 seem not to be distinct from the imagination. It seems, therefore, to
 follow that there is one intellect in all men.
"," Further, when the disciple receives knowledge from the
 master, it cannot be said that the master's knowledge begets
 knowledge in the disciple, because then also knowledge would be an
 active form, such as heat is, which is clearly false. It seems,
 therefore, that the same individual knowledge which is in the master
 is communicated to the disciple; which cannot be, unless there is
 one intellect in both. Seemingly, therefore, the intellect of the
 disciple and master is but one; and, consequently, the same applies
 to all men.
"," Further, Augustine (De Quant. Animae xxxii) says: ""If I were
 to say that there are many human souls, I should laugh at myself.""
 But the soul seems to be one chiefly on account of the intellect.
 Therefore there is one intellect of all men.
",,,,,,,,,,,," Although the intellectual soul, like an angel, has no
 matter from which it is produced, yet it is the form of a certain
 matter; in which it is unlike an angel. Therefore, according to the
 division of matter, there are many souls of one species; while it is
 quite impossible for many angels to be of one species.
"," Everything has unity in the same way that it has being;
 consequently we must judge of the multiplicity of a thing as we judge
 of its being. Now it is clear that the intellectual soul, by virtue
 of its very being, is united to the body as its form; yet, after the
 dissolution of the body, the intellectual soul retains its own being.
 In like manner the multiplicity of souls is in proportion to the
 multiplicity of the bodies; yet, after the dissolution of the bodies,
 the souls retain their multiplied being.
"," Individuality of the intelligent being, or of the
 species whereby it understands, does not exclude the understanding
 of universals; otherwise, since separate intellects are subsistent
 substances, and consequently individual, they could not understand
 universals. But the materiality of the knower, and of the species
 whereby it knows, impedes the knowledge of the universal. For as
 every action is according to the mode of the form by which the agent
 acts, as heating is according to the mode of the heat; so knowledge
 is according to the mode of the species by which the knower knows.
 Now it is clear that common nature becomes distinct and multiplied by
 reason of the individuating principles which come from the matter.
 Therefore if the form, which is the means of knowledge, is
 material--that is, not abstracted from material conditions--its
 likeness to the nature of a species or genus will be according to the
 distinction and multiplication of that nature by means of
 individuating principles; so that knowledge of the nature of a thing
 in general will be impossible. But if the species be abstracted from
 the conditions of individual matter, there will be a likeness of the
 nature without those things which make it distinct and multiplied;
 thus there will be knowledge of the universal. Nor does it matter,
 as to this particular point, whether there be one intellect or many;
 because, even if there were but one, it would necessarily be an
 individual intellect, and the species whereby it understands, an
 individual species.
"," Whether the intellect be one or many, what is
 understood is one; for what is understood is in the intellect, not
 according to its own nature, but according to its likeness; for ""the
 stone is not in the soul, but its likeness is,"" as is said, De
 Anima iii, 8. Yet it is the stone which is understood, not the
 likeness of the stone; except by a reflection of the intellect on
 itself: otherwise, the objects of sciences would not be things, but
 only intelligible species. Now it happens that different things,
 according to different forms, are likened to the same thing. And
 since knowledge is begotten according to the assimilation of the
 knower to the thing known, it follows that the same thing may happen
 to be known by several knowers; as is apparent in regard to the
 senses; for several see the same color, according to different
 likenesses. In the same way several intellects understand one object
 understood. But there is this difference, according to the opinion of
 Aristotle, between the sense and the intelligence--that a thing is
 perceived by the sense according to the disposition which it has
 outside the soul--that is, in its individuality; whereas the nature
 of the thing understood is indeed outside the soul, but the mode
 according to which it exists outside the soul is not the mode
 according to which it is understood. For the common nature is
 understood as apart from the individuating principles; whereas such
 is not its mode of existence outside the soul. But, according to the
 opinion of Plato, the thing understood exists outside the soul in the
 same condition as those under which it is understood; for he supposed
 that the natures of things exist separate from matter.
"," One knowledge exists in the disciple and another in the
 master. How it is caused will be shown later on (Q. 117, A. 1).
"," Augustine denies a plurality of souls, that would
 involve a plurality of species.

368,"[I, Q. 76, Art. 3]
","Whether Besides the Intellectual Soul There Are in Man Other Souls
"," It would seem that besides the intellectual soul there
 are in man other souls essentially different from one another, such
 as the sensitive soul and the nutritive soul. For corruptible and
 incorruptible are not of the same substance. But the intellectual
 soul is incorruptible; whereas the other souls, as the sensitive and
 the nutritive, are corruptible, as was shown above (Q. 75, A. 6).
 Therefore in man the essence of the intellectual soul, the sensitive
 soul, and the nutritive soul, cannot be the same.
"," Further, if it be said that the sensitive soul in man is
 incorruptible; on the contrary, ""corruptible and incorruptible differ
 generically,"" says the Philosopher, Metaph. x (Did. ix, 10). But
 the sensitive soul in the horse, the lion, and other brute animals,
 is corruptible. If, therefore, in man it be incorruptible, the
 sensitive soul in man and brute animals will not be of the same
 genus. Now an animal is so called from its having a sensitive soul;
 and, therefore, ""animal"" will not be one genus common to man and
 other animals, which is absurd.
"," Further, the Philosopher says, Metaph. viii (Did. vii, 2),
 that the genus is taken from the matter, and difference from the
 form. But ""rational,"" which is the difference constituting man, is
 taken from the intellectual soul; while he is called ""animal"" by
 reason of his having a body animated by a sensitive soul. Therefore
 the intellectual soul may be compared to the body animated by a
 sensitive soul, as form to matter. Therefore in man the intellectual
 soul is not essentially the same as the sensitive soul, but
 presupposes it as a material subject.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The sensitive soul is incorruptible, not by reason of
 its being sensitive, but by reason of its being intellectual. When,
 therefore, a soul is sensitive only, it is corruptible; but when with
 sensibility it has also intellectuality, it is incorruptible. For
 although sensibility does not give incorruptibility, yet it cannot
 deprive intellectuality of its incorruptibility.
"," Not forms, but composites, are classified either
 generically or specifically. Now man is corruptible like other
 animals. And so the difference of corruptible and incorruptible which
 is on the part of the forms does not involve a generic difference
 between man and the other animals.
"," The embryo has first of all a soul which is merely
 sensitive, and when this is removed, it is supplanted by a more
 perfect soul, which is both sensitive and intellectual: as will be
 shown further on (Q. 118, A. 2, ad 2).
"," We must not consider the diversity of natural things as
 proceeding from the various logical notions or intentions, which flow
 from our manner of understanding, because reason can apprehend one
 and the same thing in various ways. Therefore since, as we have said,
 the intellectual soul contains virtually what belongs to the
 sensitive soul, and something more, reason can consider separately
 what belongs to the power of the sensitive soul, as something
 imperfect and material. And because it observes that this is
 something common to man and to other animals, it forms thence the
 notion of the genus; while that wherein the intellectual soul
 exceeds the sensitive soul, it takes as formal and perfecting;
 thence it gathers the ""difference"" of man.
",,,,,,,,,,,,
369,"[I, Q. 76, Art. 4]
","Whether in Man There Is Another Form Besides the Intellectual Soul?
"," It would seem that in man there is another form besides
 the intellectual soul. For the Philosopher says (De Anima ii, 1), that
 ""the soul is the act of a physical body which has life potentially.""
 Therefore the soul is to the body as a form of matter. But the body
 has a substantial form by which it is a body. Therefore some other
 substantial form in the body precedes the soul.
"," Further, man moves himself as every animal does. Now
 everything that moves itself is divided into two parts, of which one
 moves, and the other is moved, as the Philosopher proves (Phys. viii,
 5). But the part which moves is the soul. Therefore the other part
 must be such that it can be moved. But primary matter cannot be moved
 (Phys. v, 1), since it is a being only potentially; indeed everything
 that is moved is a body. Therefore in man and in every animal there
 must be another substantial form, by which the body is constituted.
"," Further, the order of forms depends on their relation to
 primary matter; for ""before"" and ""after"" apply by comparison to some
 beginning. Therefore if there were not in man some other substantial
 form besides the rational soul, and if this were to inhere immediately
 to primary matter; it would follow that it ranks among the most
 imperfect forms which inhere to matter immediately.
"," Further, the human body is a mixed body. Now mingling does
 not result from matter alone; for then we should have mere
 corruption. Therefore the forms of the elements must remain in a
 mixed body; and these are substantial forms. Therefore in the human
 body there are other substantial forms besides the intellectual soul.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," Aristotle does not say that the soul is the act of a
 body only, but ""the act of a physical organic body which has life
 potentially""; and that this potentiality ""does not reject the soul.""
 Whence it is clear that when the soul is called the act, the soul
 itself is included; as when we say that heat is the act of what is
 hot, and light of what is lucid; not as though lucid and light were
 two separate things, but because a thing is made lucid by the light.
 In like manner, the soul is said to be the ""act of a body,"" etc.,
 because by the soul it is a body, and is organic, and has life
 potentially. Yet the first act is said to be in potentiality to the
 second act, which is operation; for such a potentiality ""does not
 reject""--that is, does not exclude--the soul.
"," The soul does not move the body by its essence, as the
 form of the body, but by the motive power, the act of which
 presupposes the body to be already actualized by the soul: so that
 the soul by its motive power is the part which moves; and the animate
 body is the part moved.
"," We observe in matter various degrees of perfection, as
 existence, living, sensing, and understanding. Now what is added is
 always more perfect. Therefore that form which gives matter only the
 first degree of perfection is the most imperfect; while that form
 which gives the first, second, and third degree, and so on, is the
 most perfect: and yet it inheres to matter immediately.
"," Avicenna held that the substantial forms of the
 elements remain entire in the mixed body; and that the mixture is
 made by the contrary qualities of the elements being reduced to an
 average. But this is impossible, because the various forms of the
 elements must necessarily be in various parts of matter; for the
 distinction of which we must suppose dimensions, without which matter
 cannot be divisible. Now matter subject to dimension is not to be
 found except in a body. But various bodies cannot be in the same
 place. Whence it follows that elements in the mixed body would be
 distinct as to situation. And then there would not be a real mixture
 which is in respect of the whole; but only a mixture apparent to
 sense, by the juxtaposition of particles.
",,,,,,,,,,,,
370,"[I, Q. 76, Art. 5]
","Whether the Intellectual Soul Is Properly United to Such a Body?
"," It would seem that the intellectual soul is improperly
 united to such a body. For matter must be proportionate to the form.
 But the intellectual soul is incorruptible. Therefore it is not
 properly united to a corruptible body.
"," Further, the intellectual soul is a perfectly immaterial
 form; a proof whereof is its operation in which corporeal matter does
 not share. But the more subtle is the body, the less has it of matter.
 Therefore the soul should be united to a most subtle body, to fire,
 for instance, and not to a mixed body, still less to a terrestrial
 body.
"," Further, since the form is the principle of the species, one
 form cannot produce a variety of species. But the intellectual soul
 is one form. Therefore, it should not be united to a body which is
 composed of parts belonging to various species.
"," Further, what is susceptible of a more perfect form should
 itself be more perfect. But the intellectual soul is the most perfect
 of souls. Therefore since the bodies of other animals are naturally
 provided with a covering, for instance, with hair instead of clothes,
 and hoofs instead of shoes; and are, moreover, naturally provided
 with arms, as claws, teeth, and horns; it seems that the intellectual
 soul should not have been united to a body which is imperfect as
 being deprived of the above means of protection.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," Perhaps someone might attempt to answer this by saying
 that before sin the human body was incorruptible. This answer does
 not seem sufficient; because before sin the human body was immortal
 not by nature, but by a gift of Divine grace; otherwise its
 immortality would not be forfeited through sin, as neither was the
 immortality of the devil.
"," A body is not necessary to the intellectual soul by
 reason of its intellectual operation considered as such; but on
 account of the sensitive power, which requires an organ of equable
 temperament. Therefore the intellectual soul had to be united to such
 a body, and not to a simple element, or to a mixed body, in which
 fire was in excess; because otherwise there could not be an
 equability of temperament. And this body of an equable temperament
 has a dignity of its own by reason of its being remote from
 contraries, thereby resembling in a way a heavenly body.
"," The parts of an animal, for instance, the eye, hand,
 flesh, and bones, and so forth, do not make the species; but the
 whole does, and therefore, properly speaking, we cannot say that
 these are of different species, but that they are of various
 dispositions. This is suitable to the intellectual soul, which,
 although it be one in its essence, yet on account of its perfection,
 is manifold in power: and therefore, for its various operations it
 requires various dispositions in the parts of the body to which it is
 united. For this reason we observe that there is a greater variety of
 parts in perfect than in imperfect animals; and in these a greater
 variety than in plants.
"," The intellectual soul as comprehending universals, has
 a power extending to the infinite; therefore it cannot be limited by
 nature to certain fixed natural notions, or even to certain fixed
 means whether of defence or of clothing, as is the case with other
 animals, the souls of which are endowed with knowledge and power in
 regard to fixed particular things. Instead of all these, man has by
 nature his reason and his hands, which are ""the organs of organs"" (De
 Anima iii), since by their means man can make for himself instruments
 of an infinite variety, and for any number of purposes.
",,,,,,,,,,,,
371,"[I, Q. 76, Art. 6]
","Whether the Intellectual Soul Is United to the Body Through the Medium
"," It would seem that the intellectual soul is united to the
 body through the medium of accidental dispositions. For every form
 exists in its proper disposed matter. But dispositions to a form are
 accidents. Therefore we must presuppose accidents to be in matter
 before the substantial form; and therefore before the soul, since the
 soul is a substantial form.
"," Further, various forms of one species require various parts
 of matter. But various parts of matter are unintelligible without
 division in measurable quantities. Therefore we must suppose
 dimensions in matter before the substantial forms, which are many
 belonging to one species.
"," Further, what is spiritual is connected with what is
 corporeal by virtual contact. But the virtue of the soul is its
 power. Therefore it seems that the soul is united to the body by
 means of a power, which is an accident.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," As appears from what has been already said (A. 4), the
 more perfect form virtually contains whatever belongs to the inferior
 forms; therefore while remaining one and the same, it perfects matter
 according to the various degrees of perfection. For the same
 essential form makes man an actual being, a body, a living being, an
 animal, and a man. Now it is clear that to every genus follow its own
 proper accidents. Therefore as matter is apprehended as perfected in
 its existence, before it is understood as corporeal, and so on; so
 those accidents which belong to existence are understood to exist
 before corporeity; and thus dispositions are understood in matter
 before the form, not as regards all its effects, but as regards the
 subsequent effect.
"," Dimensions of quantity are accidents consequent to the
 corporeity which belongs to the whole matter. Wherefore matter, once
 understood as corporeal and measurable, can be understood as distinct
 in its various parts, and as receptive of different forms according
 to the further degrees of perfection. For although it is essentially
 the same form which gives matter the various degrees of perfection,
 as we have said (ad 1), yet it is considered as different when
 brought under the observation of reason.
"," A spiritual substance which is united to a body as
 its motor only, is united thereto by power or virtue. But the
 intellectual soul is united by its very being to the body as a
 form; and yet it guides and moves the body by its power and virtue.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
372,"[I, Q. 76, Art. 7]
","Whether the Soul Is United to the Animal Body by Means of a Body?
"," It seems that the soul is united to the animal body by
 means of a body. For Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. vii, 19), that ""the
 soul administers the body by light,"" that is, by fire, ""and by air,
 which is most akin to a spirit."" But fire and air are bodies.
 Therefore the soul is united to the human body by means of a body.
"," Further, a link between two things seems to be that thing
 the removal of which involves the cessation of their union. But when
 breathing ceases, the soul is separated from the body. Therefore the
 breath, which is a subtle body, is the means of union between soul
 and body.
"," Further, things which are very distant from one another, are
 not united except by something between them. But the intellectual
 soul is very distant from the body, both because it is incorporeal,
 and because it is incorruptible. Therefore it seems to be united to
 the body by means of an incorruptible body, and such would be some
 heavenly light, which would harmonize the elements, and unite them
 together.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Augustine speaks there of the soul as it moves the
 body; whence he uses the word ""administration."" It is true that it
 moves the grosser parts of the body by the more subtle parts. And
 the first instrument of the motive power is a kind of spirit, as the
 Philosopher says in De causa motus animalium (De mot. animal. x).
"," The union of soul and body ceases at the cessation of
 breath, not because this is the means of union, but because of the
 removal of that disposition by which the body is disposed for such
 a union. Nevertheless the breath is a means of moving, as the first
 instrument of motion.
"," The soul is indeed very distant from the body, if we
 consider the condition of each separately: so that if each had a
 separate existence, many means of connection would have to intervene.
 But inasmuch as the soul is the form of the body, it has not an
 existence apart from the existence of the body, but by its own
 existence is united to the body immediately. This is the case with
 every form which, if considered as an act, is very distant from
 matter, which is a being only in potentiality.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
373,"[I, Q. 76, Art. 8]
","Whether the Soul Is in Each Part of the Body?
"," It would seem that the whole soul is not in each part of
 the body; for the Philosopher says in De causa motus animalium (De
 mot. animal. x): ""It is not necessary for the soul to be in each part
 of the body; it suffices that it be in some principle of the body
 causing the other parts to live, for each part has a natural movement
 of its own.""
"," Further, the soul is in the body of which it is the act. But
 it is the act of an organic body. Therefore it exists only in an
 organic body. But each part of the human body is not an organic body.
 Therefore the whole soul is not in each part.
"," Further, the Philosopher says (De Anima ii, 1) that the
 relation of a part of the soul to a part of the body, such as the
 sight to the pupil of the eye, is the same as the relation of the
 soul to the whole body of an animal. If, therefore, the whole soul is
 in each part of the body, it follows that each part of the body is an
 animal.
"," Further, all the powers of the soul are rooted in the essence
 of the soul. If, therefore, the whole soul be in each part of the
 body, it follows that all the powers of the soul are in each part of
 the body; thus the sight will be in the ear, and hearing in the eye,
 and this is absurd.
"," Further, if the whole soul is in each part of the body, each
 part of the body is immediately dependent on the soul. Thus one part
 would not depend on another; nor would one part be nobler than
 another; which is clearly untrue. Therefore the soul is not in each
 part of the body.
",,,,,,,,,,,,," The Philosopher is speaking there of the motive power
 of the soul.
"," The soul is the act of an organic body, as of its
 primary and proportionate perfectible.
"," An animal is that which is composed of a soul and a
 whole body, which is the soul's primary and proportionate
 perfectible. Thus the soul is not in a part. Whence it does not
 follow that a part of an animal is an animal.
"," Some of the powers of the soul are in it according as
 it exceeds the entire capacity of the body, namely the intellect and
 the will; whence these powers are not said to be in any part of the
 body. Other powers are common to the soul and body; wherefore each of
 these powers need not be wherever the soul is, but only in that part
 of the body, which is adapted to the operation of such a power.
"," One part of the body is said to be nobler than another,
 on account of the various powers, of which the parts of the body are
 the organs. For that part which is the organ of a nobler power, is a
 nobler part of the body: as also is that part which serves the same
 power in a nobler manner.
",,,,,,,,,,,
374,"[I, Q. 77, Art. 1]
","Whether the Essence of the Soul Is Its Power?
"," It would seem that the essence of the soul is its power.
 For Augustine says (De Trin. ix, 4), that ""mind, knowledge, and love
 are in the soul substantially, or, which is the same thing,
 essentially"": and (De Trin. x, 11), that ""memory, understanding, and
 will are one life, one mind, one essence.""
"," Further, the soul is nobler than primary matter. But primary
 matter is its own potentiality. Much more therefore is the soul its
 own power.
"," Further, the substantial form is simpler than the accidental
 form; a sign of which is that the substantial form is not intensified
 or relaxed, but is indivisible. But the accidental form is its own
 power. Much more therefore is that substantial form which is the soul.
"," Further, we sense by the sensitive power and we understand by
 the intellectual power. But ""that by which we first sense and
 understand"" is the soul, according to the Philosopher (De Anima ii,
 2). Therefore the soul is its own power.
"," Further, whatever does not belong to the essence is an
 accident. Therefore if the power of the soul is something else
 besides the essence thereof, it is an accident, which is contrary to
 Augustine, who says that the foregoing (see Obj. 1) ""are not in the
 soul as in a subject as color or shape, or any other quality, or
 quantity, are in a body; for whatever is so, does not exceed the
 subject in which it is: Whereas the mind can love and know other
 things"" (De Trin. ix, 4).
"," Whereas the mind can love and know other
 things"" (De Trin. ix, 4).
"," Further, ""a simple form cannot be a subject."" But the soul is
 a simple form; since it is not composed of matter and form, as we
 have said above (Q. 75, A. 5). Therefore the power of the soul cannot
 be in it as in a subject.
"," Further, an accident is not the principle of a substantial
 difference. But sensitive and rational are substantial differences;
 and they are taken from sense and reason, which are powers of the
 soul. Therefore the powers of the soul are not accidents; and so it
 would seem that the power of the soul is its own essence.
",,,,,,,,,," Augustine is speaking of the mind as it knows and loves
 itself. Thus knowledge and love as referred to the soul as known and
 loved, are substantially or essentially in the soul, for the very
 substance or essence of the soul is known and loved. In the same way
 are we to understand what he says in the other passage, that those
 things are ""one life, one mind, one essence."" Or, as some say, this
 passage is true in the sense in which the potential whole is
 predicated of its parts, being midway between the universal whole,
 and the integral whole. For the universal whole is in each part
 according to its entire essence and power; as animal in a man and in
 a horse; and therefore it is properly predicated of each part. But
 the integral whole is not in each part, neither according to its
 whole essence, nor according to its whole power. Therefore in no way
 can it be predicated of each part; yet in a way it is predicated,
 though improperly, of all the parts together; as if we were to say
 that the wall, roof, and foundations are a house. But the potential
 whole is in each part according to its whole essence, not, however,
 according to its whole power. Therefore in a way it can be predicated
 of each part, but not so properly as the universal whole. In this
 sense, Augustine says that the memory, understanding, and the will
 are the one essence of the soul.
"," The act to which primary matter is in potentiality is
 the substantial form. Therefore the potentiality of matter is nothing
 else but its essence.
"," Action belongs to the composite, as does existence;
 for to act belongs to what exists. Now the composite has substantial
 existence through the substantial form; and it operates by the power
 which results from the substantial form. Hence an active accidental
 form is to the substantial form of the agent (for instance, heat
 compared to the form of fire) as the power of the soul is to the
 soul.
"," That the accidental form is a principle of action is
 due to the substantial form. Therefore the substantial form is the
 first principle of action; but not the proximate principle. In this
 sense the Philosopher says that ""the soul is that whereby we
 understand and sense.""
"," If we take accident as meaning what is divided against
 substance, then there can be no medium between substance and
 accident; because they are divided by affirmation and negation, that
 is, according to existence in a subject, and non-existence in a
 subject. In this sense, as the power of the soul is not its essence,
 it must be an accident; and it belongs to the second species of
 accident, that of quality. But if we take accident as one of the five
 universals, in this sense there is a medium between substance and
 accident. For the substance is all that belongs to the essence of a
 thing; whereas whatever is beyond the essence of a thing cannot be
 called accident in this sense; but only what is not caused by the
 essential principle of the species. For the 'proper' does not belong
 to the essence of a thing, but is caused by the essential principles
 of the species; wherefore it is a medium between the essence and
 accident thus understood. In this sense the powers of the soul may be
 said to be a medium between substance and accident, as being natural
 properties of the soul. When Augustine says that knowledge and love
 are not in the soul as accidents in a subject, this must be
 understood in the sense given above, inasmuch as they are compared
 to the soul, not as loving and knowing, but as loved and known. His
 argument proceeds in this sense; for if love were in the soul loved
 as in a subject, it would follow that an accident transcends its
 subject, since even other things are loved through the soul.
"," Although the soul is not composed of matter and form,
 yet it has an admixture of potentiality, as we have said above (Q.
 75, A. 5, ad 4); and for this reason it can be the subject of an
 accident. The statement quoted is verified in God, Who is the Pure
 Act; in treating of which subject Boethius employs that phrase (De
 Trin. i).
"," Rational and sensitive, as differences, are not taken
 from the powers of sense and reason, but from the sensitive and
 rational soul itself. But because substantial forms, which in
 themselves are unknown to us, are known by their accidents; nothing
 prevents us from sometimes substituting accidents for substantial
 differences.

","Whether There Are Several Powers of the Soul?
"," It would seem that there are not several powers of the
 soul. For the intellectual soul approaches nearest to the likeness of
 God. But in God there is one simple power: and therefore also in the
 intellectual soul.
"," Further, the higher a power is, the more unified it is. But
 the intellectual soul excels all other forms in power. Therefore
 above all others it has one virtue or power.
"," Further, to operate belongs to what is in act. But by the
 one essence of the soul, man has actual existence in the different
 degrees of perfection, as we have seen above (Q. 76, AA. 3, 4).
 Therefore by the one power of the soul he performs operations of
 various degrees.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The intellectual soul approaches to the Divine
 likeness, more than inferior creatures, in being able to acquire
 perfect goodness; although by many and various means; and in this it
 falls short of more perfect creatures.
"," A unified power is superior if it extends to equal
 things: but a multiform power is superior to it, if it is over many
 things.
"," One thing has one substantial existence, but may have
 several operations. So there is one essence of the soul, with several
 powers.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
376,"[I, Q. 77, Art. 3]
","Whether the Powers Are Distinguished by Their Acts and Objects?
"," It would seem that the powers of the soul are not
 distinguished by acts and objects. For nothing is determined to its
 species by what is subsequent and extrinsic to it. But the act is
 subsequent to the power; and the object is extrinsic to it. Therefore
 the soul's powers are not specifically distinct by acts and objects.
"," Further, contraries are what differ most from each other.
 Therefore if the powers are distinguished by their objects, it follows
 that the same power could not have contrary objects. This is clearly
 false in almost all the powers; for the power of vision extends to
 white and black, and the power to taste to sweet and bitter.
"," Further, if the cause be removed, the effect is removed.
 Hence if the difference of powers came from the difference of objects,
 the same object would not come under different powers. This is clearly
 false; for the same thing is known by the cognitive power, and desired
 by the appetitive.
"," Further, that which of itself is the cause of anything, is
 the cause thereof, wherever it is. But various objects which belong
 to various powers, belong also to some one power; as sound and color
 belong to sight and hearing, which are different powers, yet they
 come under the one power of common sense. Therefore the powers are
 not distinguished according to the difference of their objects.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," Act, though subsequent in existence to power, is,
 nevertheless, prior to it in intention and logically; as the end is
 with regard to the agent. And the object, although extrinsic, is,
 nevertheless, the principle or end of the action; and those
 conditions which are intrinsic to a thing, are proportionate to its
 principle and end.
"," If any power were to have one of two contraries as such
 for its object, the other contrary would belong to another power. But
 the power of the soul does not regard the nature of the contrary as
 such, but rather the common aspect of both contraries; as sight does
 not regard white as such, but as color. This is because of two
 contraries one, in a manner, includes the idea of the other, since
 they are to one another as perfect and imperfect.
"," Nothing prevents things which coincide in subject, from
 being considered under different aspects; therefore they can belong
 to various powers of the soul.
"," The higher power of itself regards a more universal
 formality of the object than the lower power; because the higher a
 power is, to a greater number of things does it extend. Therefore
 many things are combined in the one formality of the object, which
 the higher power considers of itself; while they differ in the
 formalities regarded by the lower powers of themselves. Thus it is
 that various objects belong to various lower powers; which objects,
 however, are subject to one higher power.
",,,,,,,,,,,,
377,"[I, Q. 77, Art. 4]
","Whether Among the Powers of the Soul There Is Order?
"," It would seem that there is no order among the powers of
 the soul. For in those things which come under one division, there is
 no before and after, but all are naturally simultaneous. But the
 powers of the soul are contradistinguished from one another. Therefore
 there is no order among them.
"," Further, the powers of the soul are referred to their objects
 and to the soul itself. On the part of the soul, there is not order
 among them, because the soul is one. In like manner the objects are
 various and dissimilar, as color and sound. Therefore there is no
 order among the powers of the soul.
"," Further, where there is order among powers, we find that the
 operation of one depends on the operation of another. But the action
 of one power of the soul does not depend on that of another; for
 sight can act independently of hearing, and conversely. Therefore
 there is no order among the powers of the soul.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The species of a given genus are to one another as
 before and after, like numbers and figures, if considered in their
 nature; although they may be said to be simultaneous, according as
 they receive the predication of the common genus.
"," This order among the powers of the soul is both on the
 part of the soul (which, though it be one according to its essence,
 has a certain aptitude to various acts in a certain order) and on the
 part of the objects, and furthermore on the part of the acts, as we
 have said above.
"," This argument is verified as regards those powers among
 which order of the third kind exists. Those powers among which the
 two other kinds of order exist are such that the action of one

","Whether All the Powers of the Soul Are in the Soul As Their Subject?
"," It would seem that all the powers of the soul are in the
 soul as their subject. For as the powers of the body are to the body;
 so are the powers of the soul to the soul. But the body is the subject
 of the corporeal powers. Therefore the soul is the subject of the
 powers of the soul.
"," Further, the operations of the powers of the soul are
 attributed to the body by reason of the soul; because, as the
 Philosopher says (De Anima ii, 2), ""The soul is that by which we
 sense and understand primarily."" But the natural principles of the
 operations of the soul are the powers. Therefore the powers are
 primarily in the soul.
"," Further, Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. xii, 7,24) that the
 soul senses certain things, not through the body, in fact, without
 the body, as fear and such like; and some things through the body.
 But if the sensitive powers were not in the soul alone as their
 subject, the soul could not sense anything without the body.
 Therefore the soul is the subject of the sensitive powers; and for
 a similar reason, of all the other powers.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," All the powers are said to belong to the soul, not as
 their subject, but as their principle; because it is by the soul that
 the composite has the power to perform such operations.
"," All such powers are primarily in the soul, as compared
 to the composite; not as in their subject, but as in their principle.
"," Plato's opinion was that sensation is an operation
 proper to the soul, just as understanding is. Now in many things
 relating to Philosophy Augustine makes use of the opinions of Plato,
 not asserting them as true, but relating them. However, as far as the
 present question is concerned, when it is said that the soul senses
 some things with the body, and some without the body, this can be
 taken in two ways. Firstly, the words ""with the body or without the
 body"" may determine the act of sense in its mode of proceeding from
 the sentient. Thus the soul senses nothing without the body, because
 the action of sensation cannot proceed from the soul except by a
 corporeal organ. Secondly, they may be understood as determining the
 act of sense on the part of the object sensed. Thus the soul senses
 some things with the body, that is, things existing in the body, as
 when it feels a wound or something of that sort; while it senses some
 things without the body, that is, which do not exist in the body, but
 only in the apprehension of the soul, as when it feels sad or joyful
 on hearing something.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
379,"[I, Q. 77, Art. 6]
","Whether the Powers of the Soul Flow from Its Essence?
"," It would seem that the powers of the soul do not flow
 from its essence. For different things do not proceed from one
 simple thing. But the essence of the soul is one and simple. Since,
 therefore, the powers of the soul are many and various, they cannot
 proceed from its essence.
"," Further, that from which a thing proceeds is its cause.
 But the essence of the soul cannot be said to be the cause of the
 powers; as is clear if one considers the different kinds of causes.
 Therefore the powers of the soul do not flow from its essence.
"," Further, emanation involves some sort of movement. But
 nothing is moved by itself, as the Philosopher proves (Phys. vii,
 1,2); except, perhaps, by reason of a part of itself, as an animal
 is said to be moved by itself, because one part thereof moves and
 another is moved. Neither is the soul moved, as the Philosopher
 proves (De Anima i, 4). Therefore the soul does not produce its
 powers within itself.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," From one simple thing many things may proceed
 naturally, in a certain order; or again if there be diversity of
 recipients. Thus, from the one essence of the soul many and various
 powers proceed; both because order exists among these powers; and
 also by reason of the diversity of the corporeal organs.
"," The subject is both the final cause, and in a way the
 active cause, of its proper accident. It is also as it were the
 material cause, inasmuch as it is receptive of the accident. From
 this we may gather that the essence of the soul is the cause of all
 its powers, as their end, and as their active principle; and of some
 as receptive thereof.
"," The emanation of proper accidents from their subject is
 not by way of transmutation, but by a certain natural resultance;
 thus one thing results naturally from another, as color from light.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
380,"[I, Q. 77, Art. 7]
","Whether One Power of the Soul Arises from Another?
"," It would seem that one power of the soul does not arise
 from another. For if several things arise together, one of them does
 not arise from another. But all the powers of the soul are created at
 the same time with the soul. Therefore one of them does not arise from
 another.
"," Further, the power of the soul arises from the soul as an
 accident from the subject. But one power of the soul cannot be the
 subject of another; because nothing is the accident of an accident.
 Therefore one power does not arise from another.
"," Further, one opposite does not arise from the other opposite;
 but everything arises from that which is like it in species. Now the
 powers of the soul are oppositely divided, as various species.
 Therefore one of them does not proceed from another.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," As the power of the soul flows from the essence, not
 by a transmutation, but by a certain natural resultance, and is
 simultaneous with the soul, so is it the case with one power as
 regards another.
"," An accident cannot of itself be the subject of an
 accident; but one accident is received prior to another into
 substance, as quantity prior to quality. In this sense one accident
 is said to be the subject of another; as surface is of color,
 inasmuch as substance receives an accident through the means of
 another. The same thing may be said of the powers of the soul.
"," The powers of the soul are opposed to one another, as
 perfect and imperfect; as also are the species of numbers and
 figures. But this opposition does not prevent the origin of one from
 another, because imperfect things naturally proceed from perfect
 things.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
381,"[I, Q. 77, Art. 8]
","Whether All the Powers Remain in the Soul When Separated from the
"," It would seem that all the powers of the soul remain in
 the soul separated from the body. For we read in the book De Spiritu
 et Anima that ""the soul withdraws from the body, taking with itself
 sense and imagination, reason and intelligence, concupiscibility and
 irascibility.""
"," Further, the powers of the soul are its natural properties.
 But properties are always in that to which they belong; and are never
 separated from it. Therefore the powers of the soul are in it even
 after death.
"," Further, the powers even of the sensitive soul are not
 weakened when the body becomes weak; because, as the Philosopher says
 (De Anima i, 4), ""If an old man were given the eye of a young man, he
 would see even as well as a young man."" But weakness is the road to
 corruption. Therefore the powers of the soul are not corrupted when
 the body is corrupted, but remain in the separated soul.
"," Further, memory is a power of the sensitive soul, as the
 Philosopher proves (De Memor. et Remin. 1). But memory remains in the
 separated soul; for it was said to the rich glutton whose soul was in
 hell: ""Remember that thou didst receive good things during thy
 lifetime"" (Luke 16:25). Therefore memory remains in the separated
 soul; and consequently the other powers of the sensitive part.
"," Further, joy and sorrow are in the concupiscible part, which
 is a power of the sensitive soul. But it is clear that separate souls
 grieve or rejoice at the pains or rewards which they receive.
 Therefore the concupiscible power remains in the separate soul.
"," Further, Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. xii, 32) that, as the
 soul, when the body lies senseless, yet not quite dead, sees some
 things by imaginary vision; so also when by death the soul is quite
 separate from the body. But the imagination is a power of the
 sensitive part. Therefore the power of the sensitive part remains in
 the separate soul; and consequently all the other powers.
",,,,,,,,,,,," That book has no authority, and so what is there
 written can be despised with the same facility as it was said;
 although we may say that the soul takes with itself these powers,
 not actually but virtually.
"," These powers, which we say do not actually remain in
 the separate soul, are not the properties of the soul alone, but of
 the composite.
"," These powers are said not to be weakened when the body
 becomes weak, because the soul remains unchangeable, and is the
 virtual principle of these powers.
"," The recollection spoken of there is to be taken in the
 same way as Augustine (De Trin. x, 11; xiv, 7) places memory in the
 mind; not as a part of the sensitive soul.
"," In the separate soul, sorrow and joy are not in the
 sensitive, but in the intellectual appetite, as in the angels.
"," Augustine in that passage is speaking as inquiring, not
 as asserting. Wherefore he retracted some things which he had said
 there (Retrac. ii, 24).
",,,,,,,,,,
382,"[I, Q. 78, Art. 1]
","Whether There Are to Be Distinguished Five Genera of Powers in the
"," It would seem that there are not to be distinguished
 five genera of powers in the soul--namely, vegetative, sensitive,
 appetitive, locomotive, and intellectual. For the powers of the soul
 are called its parts. But only three parts of the soul are commonly
 assigned--namely, the vegetative soul, the sensitive soul, and the
 rational soul. Therefore there are only three genera of powers in
 the soul, and not five.
"," Further, the powers of the soul are the principles of its
 vital operations. Now, in four ways is a thing said to live. For the
 Philosopher says (De Anima ii, 2): ""In several ways a thing is said
 to live, and even if only one of these is present, the thing is said
 to live; as intellect and sense, local movement and rest, and lastly,
 movement of decrease and increase due to nourishment."" Therefore
 there are only four genera of powers of the soul, as the appetitive
 is excluded.
"," Further, a special kind of soul ought not to be assigned as
 regards what is common to all the powers. Now desire is common to
 each power of the soul. For sight desires an appropriate visible
 object; whence we read (Ecclus. 40:22): ""The eye desireth favor and
 beauty, but more than these green sown fields."" In the same way every
 other power desires its appropriate object. Therefore the appetitive
 power should not be made a special genus of the powers of the soul.
"," Further, the moving principle in animals is sense,
 intellect or appetite, as the Philosopher says (De Anima iii, 10).
 Therefore the motive power should not be added to the above as a
 special genus of soul.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," The ""natural appetite"" is that inclination which each
 thing has, of its own nature, for something; wherefore by its natural
 appetite each power desires something suitable to itself. But the
 ""animal appetite"" results from the form apprehended; this sort of
 appetite requires a special power of the soul--mere apprehension does
 not suffice. For a thing is desired as it exists in its own nature,
 whereas in the apprehensive power it exists not according to its own
 nature, but according to its likeness. Whence it is clear that sight
 desires naturally a visible object for the purpose of its act
 only--namely, for the purpose of seeing; but the animal by the
 appetitive power desires the thing seen, not merely for the purpose
 of seeing it, but also for other purposes. But if the soul did not
 require things perceived by the senses, except on account of the
 actions of the senses, that is, for the purpose of sensing them;
 there would be no need for a special genus of appetitive powers,
 since the natural appetite of the powers would suffice.
"," Although sense and appetite are principles of movement
 in perfect animals, yet sense and appetite, as such, are not
 sufficient to cause movement, unless another power be added to them;
 for immovable animals have sense and appetite, and yet they have not
 the power of motion. Now this motive power is not only in the
 appetite and sense as commanding the movement, but also in the parts
 of the body, to make them obey the appetite of the soul which moves
 them. Of this we have a sign in the fact that when the members are
 deprived of their natural disposition, they do not move in obedience
 to the appetite.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
383,"[I, Q. 78, Art. 2]
","Whether the Parts of the Vegetative Soul Are Fittingly Described As
"," It would seem that the parts of the vegetative soul are
 not fittingly described--namely, the nutritive, augmentative, and
 generative. For these are called ""natural"" forces. But the powers of
 the soul are above the natural forces. Therefore we should not class
 the above forces as powers of the soul.
"," Further, we should not assign a particular power of the
 soul to that which is common to living and non-living things. But
 generation is common to all things that can be generated and
 corrupted, whether living or not living. Therefore the generative
 force should not be classed as a power of the soul.
"," Further, the soul is more powerful than the body. But the
 body by the same force gives species and quantity; much more,
 therefore, does the soul. Therefore the augmentative power of the
 soul is not distinct from the generative power.
"," Further, everything is preserved in being by that whereby it
 exists. But the generative power is that whereby a living thing
 exists. Therefore by the same power the living thing is preserved.
 Now the nutritive force is directed to the preservation of the living
 thing (De Anima ii, 4), being ""a power which is capable of preserving
 whatever receives it."" Therefore we should not distinguish the
 nutritive power from the generative.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," Such forces are called natural, both because they
 produce an effect like that of nature, which also gives existence,
 quantity and preservation (although the above forces accomplish these
 things in a more perfect way); and because those forces perform their
 actions instrumentally, through the active and passive qualities,
 which are the principles of natural actions.
"," Generation of inanimate things is entirely from an
 extrinsic source; whereas the generation of living things is in a
 higher way, through something in the living thing itself, which is
 the semen containing the principle productive of the body. Therefore
 there must be in the living thing a power that prepares this semen;
 and this is the generative power.
"," Since the generation of living things is from a semen,
 it is necessary that in the beginning an animal of small size be
 generated. For this reason it must have a power in the soul, whereby
 it is brought to its appropriate size. But the inanimate body is
 generated from determinate matter by an extrinsic agent; therefore
 it receives at once its nature and its quantity, according to the
 condition of the matter.
"," As we have said above (A. 1), the operation of the
 vegetative principle is performed by means of heat, the property of
 which is to consume humidity. Therefore, in order to restore the
 humidity thus lost, the nutritive power is required, whereby the food
 is changed into the substance of the body. This is also necessary for
 the action of the augmentative and generative powers.
",,,,,,,,,,,,
384,"[I, Q. 78, Art. 3]
","Whether the Five Exterior Senses Are Properly Distinguished?
"," It would seem inaccurate to distinguish five exterior
 senses. For sense can know accidents. But there are many kinds of
 accidents. Therefore, as powers are distinguished by their objects,
 it seems that the senses are multiplied according to the number of
 the kinds of accidents.
"," Further, magnitude and shape, and other things which are
 called ""common sensibles,"" are ""not sensibles by accident,"" but are
 contradistinguished from them by the Philosopher (De Anima ii, 6).
 Now the diversity of objects, as such, diversifies the powers. Since,
 therefore, magnitude and shape are further from color than sound is,
 it seems that there is much more need for another sensitive power
 than can grasp magnitude or shape than for that which grasps color or
 sound.
"," Further, one sense regards one contrariety; as sight regards
 white and black. But the sense of touch grasps several contraries;
 such as hot or cold, damp or dry, and suchlike. Therefore it is not a
 single sense but several. Therefore there are more than five senses.
"," Further, a species is not divided against its genus. But
 taste is a kind of touch. Therefore it should not be classed as a
 distinct sense of touch.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," Not every accident has in itself a power of immutation
 but only qualities of the third species, which are the principles of
 alteration: therefore only suchlike qualities are the objects of the
 senses; because ""the senses are affected by the same things whereby
 inanimate bodies are affected,"" as stated in Phys. vii, 2.
"," Size, shape, and the like, which are called ""common
 sensibles,"" are midway between ""accidental sensibles"" and ""proper
 sensibles,"" which are the objects of the senses. For the proper
 sensibles first, and of their very nature, affect the senses; since
 they are qualities that cause alteration. But the common sensibles
 are all reducible to quantity. As to size and number, it is clear
 that they are species of quantity. Shape is a quality about quantity,
 since the notion of shape consists of fixing the bounds of magnitude.
 Movement and rest are sensed according as the subject is affected in
 one or more ways in the magnitude of the subject or of its local
 distance, as in the movement of growth or of locomotion, or again,
 according as it is affected in some sensible qualities, as in the
 movement of alteration; and thus to sense movement and rest is, in a
 way, to sense one thing and many. Now quantity is the proximate
 subject of the qualities that cause alteration, as surface is of
 color. Therefore the common sensibles do not move the senses first
 and of their own nature, but by reason of the sensible quality; as
 the surface by reason of color. Yet they are not accidental
 sensibles, for they produce a certain variety in the immutation of
 the senses. For sense is immuted differently by a large and by a
 small surface: since whiteness itself is said to be great or small,
 and therefore it is divided according to its proper subject.
"," As the Philosopher seems to say (De Anima ii, 11),
 the sense of touch is generically one, but is divided into several
 specific senses, and for this reason it extends to various
 contrarieties; which senses, however, are not separate from one
 another in their organ, but are spread throughout the whole body, so
 that their distinction is not evident. But taste, which perceives the
 sweet and the bitter, accompanies touch in the tongue, but not in the
 whole body; so it is easily distinguished from touch. We might also
 say that all those contrarieties agree, each in some proximate genus,
 and all in a common genus, which is the common and formal object of
 touch. Such common genus is, however, unnamed, just as the proximate
 genus of hot and cold is unnamed.
"," The sense of taste, according to a saying of the
 Philosopher (De Anima ii, 9), is a kind of touch existing in the
 tongue only. It is not distinct from touch in general, but only from
 the species of touch distributed in the body. But if touch is one
 sense only, on account of the common formality of its object: we must
 say that taste is distinguished from touch by reason of a different
 formality of immutation. For touch involves a natural, and not only a
 spiritual, immutation in its organ, by reason of the quality which is
 its proper object. But the organ of taste is not necessarily immuted
 by a natural immutation by reason of the quality which is its proper
 object, so that the tongue itself becomes sweet and bitter: but by
 reason of a quality which is a preamble to, and on which is based,
 the flavor, which quality is moisture, the object of touch.

385,"[I, Q. 78, Art. 4]
","Whether the Interior Senses Are Suitably Distinguished?
"," It would seem that the interior senses are not suitably
 distinguished. For the common is not divided against the proper.
 Therefore the common sense should not be numbered among the interior
 sensitive powers, in addition to the proper exterior senses.
"," Further, there is no need to assign an interior power of
 apprehension when the proper and exterior sense suffices. But the
 proper and exterior senses suffice for us to judge of sensible things;
 for each sense judges of its proper object. In like manner they seem
 to suffice for the perception of their own actions; for since the
 action of the sense is, in a way, between the power and its object, it
 seems that sight must be much more able to perceive its own vision, as
 being nearer to it, than the color; and in like manner with the other
 senses. Therefore for this there is no need to assign an interior
 power, called the common sense.
"," Further, according to the Philosopher (De Memor. et Remin.
 i), the imagination and the memory are passions of the ""first
 sensitive."" But passion is not divided against its subject. Therefore
 memory and imagination should not be assigned as powers distinct from
 the senses.
"," Further, the intellect depends on the senses less than any
 power of the sensitive part. But the intellect knows nothing but what
 it receives from the senses; whence we read (Poster. i, 8), that
 ""those who lack one sense lack one kind of knowledge."" Therefore much
 less should we assign to the sensitive part a power, which they call
 the ""estimative"" power, for the perception of intentions which the
 sense does not perceive.
"," Further, the action of the cogitative power, which consists
 in comparing, adding and dividing, and the action of the
 reminiscence, which consists in the use of a kind of syllogism for
 the sake of inquiry, is not less distant from the actions of the
 estimative and memorative powers, than the action of the estimative
 is from the action of the imagination. Therefore either we must add
 the cognitive and reminiscitive to the estimative and memorative
 powers, or the estimative and memorative powers should not be made
 distinct from the imagination.
"," Further, Augustine (Gen. ad lit. xii, 6, 7, 24) describes
 three kinds of vision; namely, corporeal, which is the action of the
 sense; spiritual, which is an action of the imagination or phantasy;
 and intellectual, which is an action of the intellect. Therefore there
 is no interior power between the sense and intellect, besides the
 imagination.
",,,,,,,,,,,," The interior sense is called ""common"" not by
 predication, as if it were a genus; but as the common root and
 principle of the exterior senses.
"," The proper sense judges of the proper sensible by
 discerning it from other things which come under the same sense; for
 instance, by discerning white from black or green. But neither sight
 nor taste can discern white from sweet: because what discerns between
 two things must know both. Wherefore the discerning judgment must be
 assigned to the common sense; to which, as to a common term, all
 apprehensions of the senses must be referred: and by which, again,
 all the intentions of the senses are perceived; as when someone sees
 that he sees. For this cannot be done by the proper sense, which only
 knows the form of the sensible by which it is immuted, in which
 immutation the action of sight is completed, and from immutation
 follows another in the common sense which perceives the act of vision.
"," As one power arises from the soul by means of another,
 as we have seen above (Q. 77, A. 7), so also the soul is the subject
 of one power through another. In this way the imagination and the
 memory are called passions of the ""first sensitive.""
"," Although the operation of the intellect has its origin
 in the senses: yet, in the thing apprehended through the senses, the
 intellect knows many things which the senses cannot perceive. In like
 manner does the estimative power, though in a less perfect manner.
"," The cogitative and memorative powers in man owe their
 excellence not to that which is proper to the sensitive part; but to
 a certain affinity and proximity to the universal reason, which, so
 to speak, overflows into them. Therefore they are not distinct
 powers, but the same, yet more perfect than in other animals.
"," Augustine calls that vision spiritual which is effected
 by the images of bodies in the absence of bodies. Whence it is clear
 that it is common to all interior apprehensions.
",,,,,,,,,,
386,"[I, Q. 79, Art. 1]
","Whether the Intellect Is a Power of the Soul?
"," It would seem that the intellect is not a power of the
 soul, but the essence of the soul. For the intellect seems to be the
 same as the mind. Now the mind is not a power of the soul, but the
 essence; for Augustine says (De Trin. ix, 2): ""Mind and spirit are not
 relative things, but denominate the essence."" Therefore the intellect
 is the essence of the soul.
"," Further, different genera of the soul's powers are not united
 in some one power, but only in the essence of the soul. Now the
 appetitive and the intellectual are different genera of the soul's
 powers as the Philosopher says (De Anima ii, 3), but they are united
 in the mind, for Augustine (De Trin. x, 11) places the intelligence
 and will in the mind. Therefore the mind and intellect of man is of
 the very essence of the soul and not a power thereof.
"," Further, according to Gregory, in a homily for the Ascension
 (xxix in Ev.), ""man understands with the angels."" But angels are
 called ""minds"" and ""intellects."" Therefore the mind and intellect of
 man are not a power of the soul, but the soul itself.
"," Further, a substance is intellectual by the fact that it is
 immaterial. But the soul is immaterial through its essence. Therefore
 it seems that the soul must be intellectual through its essence.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," Sense is sometimes taken for the power, and sometimes
 for the sensitive soul; for the sensitive soul takes its name from
 its chief power, which is sense. And in like manner the intellectual
 soul is sometimes called intellect, as from its chief power; and thus
 we read (De Anima i, 4), that the ""intellect is a substance."" And in
 this sense also Augustine says that the mind is spirit and essence
 (De Trin. ix, 2; xiv, 16).
"," The appetitive and intellectual powers are different
 genera of powers in the soul, by reason of the different formalities
 of their objects. But the appetitive power agrees partly with the
 intellectual power and partly with the sensitive in its mode of
 operation either through a corporeal organ or without it: for
 appetite follows apprehension. And in this way Augustine puts the
 will in the mind; and the Philosopher, in the reason (De Anima iii,
 9).
"," In the angels there is no other power besides the
 intellect, and the will, which follows the intellect. And for this
 reason an angel is called a ""mind"" or an ""intellect""; because his
 whole power consists in this. But the soul has many other powers,
 such as the sensitive and nutritive powers, and therefore the
 comparison fails.
"," The immateriality of the created intelligent substance
 is not its intellect; and through its immateriality it has the power
 of intelligence. Wherefore it follows not that the intellect is the
 substance of the soul, but that it is its virtue and power.
",,,,,,,,,,,,
387,"[I, Q. 79, Art. 2]
","Whether the Intellect Is a Passive Power?
"," It would seem that the intellect is not a passive power.
 For everything is passive by its matter, and acts by its form. But the
 intellectual power results from the immateriality of the intelligent
 substance. Therefore it seems that the intellect is not a passive
 power.
"," Further, the intellectual power is incorruptible, as we have
 said above (Q. 79, A. 6). But ""if the intellect is passive, it is
 corruptible"" (De Anima iii, 5). Therefore the intellectual power is
 not passive.
"," Further, the ""agent is nobler than the patient,"" as Augustine
 (Gen. ad lit. xii, 16) and Aristotle (De Anima iii, 5) says. But all
 the powers of the vegetative part are active; yet they are the lowest
 among the powers of the soul. Much more, therefore, all the
 intellectual powers, which are the highest, are active.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," This objection is verified of passion in the first and
 second senses, which belong to primary matter. But in the third sense
 passion is in anything which is reduced from potentiality to act.
"," ""Passive intellect"" is the name given by some to the
 sensitive appetite, in which are the passions of the soul; which
 appetite is also called ""rational by participation,"" because it
 ""obeys the reason"" (Ethic. i, 13). Others give the name of passive
 intellect to the cogitative power, which is called the ""particular
 reason."" And in each case ""passive"" may be taken in the two first
 senses; forasmuch as this so-called intellect is the act of a
 corporeal organ. But the intellect which is in potentiality to things
 intelligible, and which for this reason Aristotle calls the
 ""possible"" intellect (De Anima iii, 4) is not passive except in the
 third sense: for it is not an act of a corporeal organ. Hence it is
 incorruptible.
"," The agent is nobler than the patient, if the action and
 the passion are referred to the same thing: but not always, if they
 refer to different things. Now the intellect is a passive power in
 regard to the whole universal being: while the vegetative power is
 active in regard to some particular thing, namely, the body as united
 to the soul. Wherefore nothing prevents such a passive force being
 nobler than such an active one.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
388,"[I, Q. 79, Art. 3]
","Whether There Is an Active Intellect?
"," It would seem that there is no active intellect. For as
 the senses are to things sensible, so is our intellect to things
 intelligible. But because sense is in potentiality to things sensible,
 the sense is not said to be active, but only passive. Therefore, since
 our intellect is in potentiality to things intelligible, it seems that
 we cannot say that the intellect is active, but only that it is
 passive.
"," Further, if we say that also in the senses there is something
 active, such as light: on the contrary, light is required for sight,
 inasmuch as it makes the medium to be actually luminous; for color of
 its own nature moves the luminous medium. But in the operation of the
 intellect there is no appointed medium that has to be brought into
 act. Therefore there is no necessity for an active intellect.
"," Further, the likeness of the agent is received into the
 patient according to the nature of the patient. But the passive
 intellect is an immaterial power. Therefore its immaterial nature
 suffices for forms to be received into it immaterially. Now a form
 is intelligible in act from the very fact that it is immaterial.
 Therefore there is no need for an active intellect to make the
 species actually intelligible.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Sensible things are found in act outside the soul; and
 hence there is no need for an active sense. Wherefore it is clear
 that in the nutritive part all the powers are active, whereas in the
 sensitive part all are passive: but in the intellectual part, there
 is something active and something passive.
"," There are two opinions as to the effect of light. For
 some say that light is required for sight, in order to make colors
 actually visible. And according to this the active intellect is
 required for understanding, in like manner and for the same reason as
 light is required for seeing. But in the opinion of others, light is
 required for sight; not for the colors to become actually visible;
 but in order that the medium may become actually luminous, as the
 Commentator says on De Anima ii. And according to this, Aristotle's
 comparison of the active intellect to light is verified in this, that
 as it is required for understanding, so is light required for seeing;
 but not for the same reason.
"," If the agent pre-exist, it may well happen that its
 likeness is received variously into various things, on account of
 their dispositions. But if the agent does not pre-exist, the
 disposition of the recipient has nothing to do with the matter. Now
 the intelligible in act is not something existing in nature; if we
 consider the nature of things sensible, which do not subsist apart
 from matter. And therefore in order to understand them, the
 immaterial nature of the passive intellect would not suffice but for
 the presence of the active intellect which makes things actually

","Whether the Active Intellect Is Something in the Soul?
"," It would seem that the active intellect is not something
 in the soul. For the effect of the active intellect is to give light
 for the purpose of understanding. But this is done by something higher
 than the soul: according to John 1:9, ""He was the true light that
 enlighteneth every man coming into this world."" Therefore the active
 intellect is not something in the soul.
"," Further, the Philosopher (De Anima iii, 5) says of the active
 intellect, ""that it does not sometimes understand and sometimes not
 understand."" But our soul does not always understand: sometimes it
 understands, sometimes it does not understand. Therefore the active
 intellect is not something in our soul.
"," Further, agent and patient suffice for action. If, therefore,
 the passive intellect, which is a passive power, is something
 belonging to the soul; and also the active intellect, which is an
 active power: it follows that a man would always be able to
 understand when he wished, which is clearly false. Therefore the
 active intellect is not something in our soul.
"," Further, the Philosopher (De Anima iii, 5) says that the
 active intellect is a ""substance in actual being."" But nothing can
 be in potentiality and in act with regard to the same thing. If,
 therefore, the passive intellect, which is in potentiality to all
 things intelligible, is something in the soul, it seems impossible
 for the active intellect to be also something in our soul.
"," Further, if the active intellect is something in the soul,
 it must be a power. For it is neither a passion nor a habit; since
 habits and passions are not in the nature of agents in regard to the
 passivity of the soul; but rather passion is the very action of the
 passive power; while habit is something which results from acts. But
 every power flows from the essence of the soul. It would therefore
 follow that the active intellect flows from the essence of the soul.
 And thus it would not be in the soul by way of participation from
 some higher intellect: which is unfitting. Therefore the active
 intellect is not something in our soul.
",,,,,,,,,,,,," That true light enlightens as a universal cause, from
 which the human soul derives a particular power, as we have explained.
"," The Philosopher says those words not of the active
 intellect, but of the intellect in act: of which he had already said:
 ""Knowledge in act is the same as the thing."" Or, if we refer those
 words to the active intellect, then they are said because it is not
 owing to the active intellect that sometimes we do, and sometimes we
 do not understand, but to the intellect which is in potentiality.
"," If the relation of the active intellect to the passive
 were that of the active object to a power, as, for instance, of the
 visible in act to the sight; it would follow that we could understand
 all things instantly, since the active intellect is that which makes
 all things (in act). But now the active intellect is not an object,
 rather is it that whereby the objects are made to be in act: for
 which, besides the presence of the active intellect, we require the
 presence of phantasms, the good disposition of the sensitive powers,
 and practice in this sort of operation; since through one thing
 understood, other things come to be understood, as from terms are
 made propositions, and from first principles, conclusions. From this
 point of view it matters not whether the active intellect is
 something belonging to the soul, or something separate from the soul.
"," The intellectual soul is indeed actually immaterial,
 but it is in potentiality to determinate species. On the contrary,
 phantasms are actual images of certain species, but are immaterial in
 potentiality. Wherefore nothing prevents one and the same soul,
 inasmuch as it is actually immaterial, having one power by which it
 makes things actually immaterial, by abstraction from the conditions
 of individual matter: which power is called the ""active intellect"";
 and another power, receptive of such species, which is called the
 ""passive intellect"" by reason of its being in potentiality to such
 species.
"," Since the essence of the soul is immaterial, created by
 the supreme intellect, nothing prevents that power which it derives
 from the supreme intellect, and whereby it abstracts from matter,
 flowing from the essence of the soul, in the same way as its other
 powers.

","Whether the Active Intellect Is One in All?
"," It would seem that there is one active intellect in all.
 For what is separate from the body is not multiplied according to the
 number of bodies. But the active intellect is ""separate,"" as the
 Philosopher says (De Anima iii, 5). Therefore it is not multiplied in
 the many human bodies, but is one for all men.
"," Further, the active intellect is the cause of the universal,
 which is one in many. But that which is the cause of unity is still
 more itself one. Therefore the active intellect is the same in all.
"," Further, all men agree in the first intellectual concepts.
 But to these they assent by the active intellect. Therefore all
 agree in one active intellect.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The Philosopher proves that the active intellect is
 separate, by the fact that the passive intellect is separate:
 because, as he says (De Anima iii, 5), ""the agent is more noble than
 the patient."" Now the passive intellect is said to be separate,
 because it is not the act of any corporeal organ. And in the same
 sense the active intellect is also called ""separate""; but not as a
 separate substance.
"," The active intellect is the cause of the universal, by
 abstracting it from matter. But for this purpose it need not be the
 same intellect in all intelligent beings; but it must be one in its
 relationship to all those things from which it abstracts the
 universal, with respect to which things the universal is one. And
 this befits the active intellect inasmuch as it is immaterial.
"," All things which are of one species enjoy in common the
 action which accompanies the nature of the species, and consequently
 the power which is the principle of such action; but not so as that
 power be identical in all. Now to know the first intelligible
 principles is the action belonging to the human species. Wherefore
 all men enjoy in common the power which is the principle of this
 action: and this power is the active intellect. But there is no need
 for it to be identical in all. Yet it must be derived by all from one
 principle. And thus the possession by all men in common of the first
 principles proves the unity of the separate intellect, which Plato
 compares to the sun; but not the unity of the active intellect, which
 Aristotle compares to light.

391,"[I, Q. 79, Art. 6]
","Whether Memory Is in the Intellectual Part of the Soul?
"," It would seem that memory is not in the intellectual
 part of the soul. For Augustine says (De Trin. xii, 2,3,8) that to
 the higher part of the soul belongs those things which are not
 ""common to man and beast."" But memory is common to man and beast,
 for he says (De Trin. xii, 2, 3, 8) that ""beasts can sense corporeal
 things through the senses of the body, and commit them to memory.""
 Therefore memory does not belong to the intellectual part of the
 soul.
"," Further, memory is of the past. But the past is said of
 something with regard to a fixed time. Memory, therefore, knows a
 thing under a condition of a fixed time; which involves knowledge
 under the conditions of ""here"" and ""now."" But this is not the
 province of the intellect, but of the sense. Therefore memory is
 not in the intellectual part, but only in the sensitive.
"," Further, in the memory are preserved the species of those
 things of which we are not actually thinking. But this cannot happen
 in the intellect, because the intellect is reduced to act by the fact
 that the intelligible species are received into it. Now the intellect
 in act implies understanding in act; and therefore the intellect
 actually understands all things of which it has the species.
 Therefore the memory is not in the intellectual part.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Memory, if considered as retentive of species, is not
 common to us and other animals. For species are not retained in the
 sensitive part of the soul only, but rather in the body and soul
 united: since the memorative power is the act of some organ. But the
 intellect in itself is retentive of species, without the association
 of any corporeal organ. Wherefore the Philosopher says (De Anima iii,
 4) that ""the soul is the seat of the species, not the whole soul, but
 the intellect.""
"," The condition of past may be referred to two
 things--namely, to the object which is known, and to the act of
 knowledge. These two are found together in the sensitive part, which
 apprehends something from the fact of its being immuted by a present
 sensible: wherefore at the same time an animal remembers to have
 sensed before in the past, and to have sensed some past sensible
 thing. But as concerns the intellectual part, the past is accidental,
 and is not in itself a part of the object of the intellect. For the
 intellect understands man, as man: and to man, as man, it is
 accidental that he exist in the present, past, or future. But on the
 part of the act, the condition of past, even as such, may be
 understood to be in the intellect, as well as in the senses. Because
 our soul's act of understanding is an individual act, existing in
 this or that time, inasmuch as a man is said to understand now, or
 yesterday, or tomorrow. And this is not incompatible with the
 intellectual nature: for such an act of understanding, though
 something individual, is yet an immaterial act, as we have said above
 of the intellect (Q. 76, A. 1); and therefore, as the intellect
 understands itself, though it be itself an individual intellect, so
 also it understands its act of understanding, which is an individual
 act, in the past, present, or future. In this way, then, the notion
 of memory, in as far as it regards past events, is preserved in the
 intellect, forasmuch as it understands that it previously understood:
 but not in the sense that it understands the past as something ""here""
 and ""now.""
"," The intelligible species is sometimes in the intellect
 only in potentiality, and then the intellect is said to be in
 potentiality. Sometimes the intelligible species is in the intellect
 as regards the ultimate completion of the act, and then it
 understands in act. And sometimes the intelligible species is in a
 middle state, between potentiality and act: and then we have habitual
 knowledge. In this way the intellect retains the species, even when
 it does not understand in act.

","Whether the Intellectual Memory Is a Power Distinct from the Intellect?
"," It would seem that the intellectual memory is distinct
 from the intellect. For Augustine (De Trin. x, 11) assigns to the soul
 memory, understanding, and will. But it is clear that the memory is a
 distinct power from the will. Therefore it is also distinct from the
 intellect.
"," Further, the reason of distinction among the powers in the
 sensitive part is the same as in the intellectual part. But memory in
 the sensitive part is distinct from sense, as we have said (Q. 78, A.
 4). Therefore memory in the intellectual part is distinct from the
 intellect.
"," Further, according to Augustine (De Trin. x, 11; xi, 7),
 memory, understanding, and will are equal to one another, and one
 flows from the other. But this could not be if memory and intellect
 were the same power. Therefore they are not the same power.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Although it is said (3 Sent. D, 1) that memory,
 intellect, and will are three powers, this is not in accordance with
 the meaning of Augustine, who says expressly (De Trin. xiv) that ""if
 we take memory, intelligence, and will as always present in the soul,
 whether we actually attend to them or not, they seem to pertain to the
 memory only. And by intelligence I mean that by which we understand
 when actually thinking; and by will I mean that love or affection
 which unites the child and its parent."" Wherefore it is clear that
 Augustine does not take the above three for three powers; but by
 memory he understands the soul's habit of retention; by intelligence,
 the act of the intellect; and by will, the act of the will.
"," Past and present may differentiate the sensitive
 powers, but not the intellectual powers, for the reason give above.
"," Intelligence arises from memory, as act from
 habit; and in this way it is equal to it, but not as a power to
 a power.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
393,"[I, Q. 79, Art. 8]
","Whether the Reason Is Distinct from the Intellect?
"," It would seem that the reason is a distinct power from
 the intellect. For it is stated in De Spiritu et Anima that ""when we
 wish to rise from lower things to higher, first the sense comes to our
 aid, then imagination, then reason, then the intellect."" Therefore the
 reason is distinct from the intellect, as imagination is from sense.
"," Further, Boethius says (De Consol. iv, 6), that intellect is
 compared to reason, as eternity to time. But it does not belong to
 the same power to be in eternity and to be in time. Therefore reason
 and intellect are not the same power.
"," Further, man has intellect in common with the angels, and
 sense in common with the brutes. But reason, which is proper to man,
 whence he is called a rational animal, is a power distinct from sense.
 Therefore is it equally true to say that it is distinct from the
 intellect, which properly belongs to the angel: whence they are called
 intellectual.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," That enumeration is made according to the order of
 actions, not according to the distinction of powers. Moreover, that
 book is not of great authority.
"," The answer is clear from what we have said. For
 eternity is compared to time as immovable to movable. And thus
 Boethius compared the intellect to eternity, and reason to time.
"," Other animals are so much lower than man that they
 cannot attain to the knowledge of truth, which reason seeks. But
 man attains, although imperfectly, to the knowledge of intelligible
 truth, which angels know. Therefore in the angels the power of
 knowledge is not of a different genus from that which is in the
 human reason, but is compared to it as the perfect to the imperfect.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
394,"[I, Q. 79, Art. 9]
","Whether the Higher and Lower Reason Are Distinct Powers?
"," It would seem that the higher and lower reason are
 distinct powers. For Augustine says (De Trin. xii, 4,7), that the
 image of the Trinity is in the higher part of the reason, and not in
 the lower. But the parts of the soul are its powers. Therefore the
 higher and lower reason are two powers.
"," Further, nothing flows from itself. Now, the lower reason
 flows from the higher, and is ruled and directed by it. Therefore the
 higher reason is another power from the lower.
"," Further, the Philosopher says (Ethic. vi, 1) that ""the
 scientific part"" of the soul, by which the soul knows necessary
 things, is another principle, and another part from the ""opinionative""
 and ""reasoning"" part by which it knows contingent things. And he
 proves this from the principle that for those things which are
 ""generically different, generically different parts of the soul are
 ordained."" Now contingent and necessary are generically different, as
 corruptible and incorruptible. Since, therefore, necessary is the same
 as eternal, and temporal the same as contingent, it seems that what
 the Philosopher calls the ""scientific"" part must be the same as the
 higher reason, which, according to Augustine (De Trin. xii, 7) ""is
 intent on the consideration and consultation of things eternal""; and
 that what the Philosopher calls the ""reasoning"" or ""opinionative"" part
 is the same as the lower reason, which, according to Augustine, ""is
 intent on the disposal of temporal things."" Therefore the higher
 reason is another power than the lower.
"," Further, Damascene says (De Fide Orth. ii) that ""opinion
 rises from the imagination: then the mind by judging of the truth or
 error of the opinion discovers the truth: whence mens (mind) is
 derived from metiendo (measuring). And therefore the intellect
 regards those things which are already subject to judgment and true
 decision."" Therefore the opinionative power, which is the lower
 reason, is distinct from the mind and the intellect, by which we may
 understand the higher reason.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," We speak of parts, in whatever way a thing is divided.
 And so far as reason is divided according to its various acts, the
 higher and lower reason are called parts; but not because they are
 different powers.
"," The lower reason is said to flow from the higher, or
 to be ruled by it, as far as the principles made use of by the lower
 reason are drawn from and directed by the principles of the higher
 reason.
"," The ""scientific"" part, of which the Philosopher speaks,
 is not the same as the higher reason: for necessary truths are found
 even among temporal things, of which natural science and mathematics
 treat. And the ""opinionative"" and ""ratiocinative"" part is more
 limited than the lower reason; for it regards only things contingent.
 Neither must we say, without any qualification, that a power, by
 which the intellect knows necessary things, is distinct from a power
 by which it knows contingent things: because it knows both under the
 same objective aspect--namely, under the aspect of being and truth.
 Wherefore it perfectly knows necessary things which have perfect
 being in truth; since it penetrates to their very essence, from which
 it demonstrates their proper accidents. On the other hand, it knows
 contingent things, but imperfectly; forasmuch as they have but
 imperfect being and truth. Now perfect and imperfect in the action do
 not vary the power, but they vary the actions as to the mode of
 acting, and consequently the principles of the actions and the habits
 themselves. And therefore the Philosopher postulates two lesser parts
 of the soul--namely, the ""scientific"" and the ""ratiocinative,"" not
 because they are two powers, but because they are distinct according
 to a different aptitude for receiving various habits, concerning the
 variety of which he inquires. For contingent and necessary, though
 differing according to their proper genera, nevertheless agree in the
 common aspect of being, which the intellect considers, and to which
 they are variously compared as perfect and imperfect.
"," That distinction given by Damascene is according to
 the variety of acts, not according to the variety of powers. For
 ""opinion"" signifies an act of the intellect which leans to one side
 of a contradiction, whilst in fear of the other. While to ""judge"" or
 ""measure"" [mensurare] is an act of the intellect, applying certain
 principles to examine propositions. From this is taken the word
 ""mens"" [mind]. Lastly, to ""understand"" is to adhere to the formed
 judgment with approval.

395,"[I, Q. 79, Art. 10]
","Whether Intelligence Is a Power Distinct from Intellect?
"," It would seem that the intelligence is another power than
 the intellect. For we read in De Spiritu et Anima that ""when we wish
 to rise from lower to higher things, first the sense comes to our aid,
 then imagination, then reason, then intellect, and afterwards
 intelligence."" But imagination and sense are distinct powers.
 Therefore also intellect and intelligence are distinct.
"," Further, Boethius says (De Consol. v, 4) that ""sense
 considers man in one way, imagination in another, reason in another,
 intelligence in another."" But intellect is the same power as reason.
 Therefore, seemingly, intelligence is a distinct power from
 intellect, as reason is a distinct power from imagination or sense.
"," Further, ""actions came before powers,"" as the Philosopher
 says (De Anima ii, 4). But intelligence is an act separate from
 others attributed to the intellect. For Damascene says (De Fide Orth.
 ii) that ""the first movement is called intelligence; but that
 intelligence which is about a certain thing is called intention; that
 which remains and conforms the soul to that which is understood is
 called invention, and invention when it remains in the same man,
 examining and judging of itself, is called phronesis (that is,
 wisdom), and phronesis if dilated makes thought, that is, orderly
 internal speech; from which, they say, comes speech expressed by the
 tongue."" Therefore it seems that intelligence is some special power.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," If this authority is accepted, intelligence there means
 the act of the intellect. And thus it is divided against intellect as
 act against power.
"," Boethius takes intelligence as meaning that act of the
 intellect which transcends the act of the reason. Wherefore he also
 says that reason alone belongs to the human race, as intelligence
 alone belongs to God, for it belongs to God to understand all things
 without any investigation.
"," All those acts which Damascene enumerates belong to one
 power--namely, the intellectual power. For this power first of all
 only apprehends something; and this act is called ""intelligence.""
 Secondly, it directs what it apprehends to the knowledge of something
 else, or to some operation; and this is called ""intention."" And when
 it goes on in search of what it ""intends,"" it is called ""invention.""
 When, by reference to something known for certain, it examines what
 it has found, it is said to know or to be wise, which belongs to
 ""phronesis"" or ""wisdom""; for ""it belongs to the wise man to judge,""
 as the Philosopher says (Metaph. i, 2). And when once it has obtained
 something for certain, as being fully examined, it thinks about the
 means of making it known to others; and this is the ordering of
 ""interior speech,"" from which proceeds ""external speech."" For every
 difference of acts does not make the powers vary, but only what
 cannot be reduced to the one same principle, as we have said above
 (Q. 78, A. 4).

","Whether the Speculative and Practical Intellects Are Distinct Powers?
"," It would seem that the speculative and practical
 intellects are distinct powers. For the apprehensive and motive are
 different kinds of powers, as is clear from De Anima ii, 3. But
 the speculative intellect is merely an apprehensive power; while the
 practical intellect is a motive power. Therefore they are distinct
 powers.
"," Further, the different nature of the object differentiates
 the power. But the object of the speculative intellect is truth,
 and of the practical is good; which differ in nature. Therefore the
 speculative and practical intellect are distinct powers.
"," Further, in the intellectual part, the practical intellect is
 compared to the speculative, as the estimative is to the imaginative
 power in the sensitive part. But the estimative differs from the
 imaginative, as power form power, as we have said above (Q. 78, A.
 4). Therefore also the speculative intellect differs from the
 practical.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The practical intellect is a motive power, not as
 executing movement, but as directing towards it; and this belongs to
 it according to its mode of apprehension.
"," Truth and good include one another; for truth is
 something good, otherwise it would not be desirable; and good is
 something true, otherwise it would not be intelligible. Therefore as
 the object of the appetite may be something true, as having the
 aspect of good, for example, when some one desires to know the truth;
 so the object of the practical intellect is good directed to the
 operation, and under the aspect of truth. For the practical intellect
 knows truth, just as the speculative, but it directs the known truth
 to operation.
"," Many differences differentiate the sensitive powers,
 which do not differentiate the intellectual powers, as we have said
 above (A. 7, ad 2; Q. 77, A. 3, ad 4).

","Whether Synderesis Is a Special Power of the Soul Distinct from the

 distinct from the others. For those things which fall under one
 division, seem to be of the same genus. But in the gloss of Jerome
 on Ezech. 1:6, ""synderesis"" is divided against the irascible, the
 concupiscible, and the rational, which are powers. Therefore
 ""synderesis"" is a power.
"," Further, opposite things are of the same genus. But
 ""synderesis"" and sensuality seem to be opposed to one another because
 ""synderesis"" always incites to good; while sensuality always incites
 to evil: whence it is signified by the serpent, as is clear from
 Augustine (De Trin. xii, 12,13). It seems, therefore, that
 ""synderesis"" is a power just as sensuality is.
"," Further, Augustine says (De Lib. Arb. ii, 10) that in the
 natural power of judgment there are certain ""rules and seeds of
 virtue, both true and unchangeable."" And this is what we call
 synderesis. Since, therefore, the unchangeable rules which guide our
 judgment belong to the reason as to its higher part, as Augustine says
 (De Trin. xii, 2), it seems that ""synderesis"" is the same as reason:
 and thus it is a power.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The division given by Jerome is taken from the variety
 of acts, and not from the variety of powers; and various acts can
 belong to one power.
"," In like manner, the opposition of sensuality to
 ""syneresis"" is an opposition of acts, and not of the different
 species of one genus.
"," Those unchangeable notions are the first practical
 principles, concerning which no one errs; and they are attributed to
 reason as to a power, and to ""synderesis"" as to a habit. Wherefore
 we judge naturally both by our reason and by ""synderesis.""

","Whether Conscience Be a Power?
"," It would seem that conscience is a power; for Origen
 says [*Commentary on Rom. 2:15] that ""conscience is a correcting and
 guiding spirit accompanying the soul, by which it is led away from
 evil and made to cling to good."" But in the soul, spirit designates a
 power--either the mind itself, according to the text (Eph. 4:13), ""Be
 ye renewed in the spirit of your mind""--or the imagination, whence
 imaginary vision is called spiritual, as Augustine says (Gen. ad lit.
 xii, 7,24). Therefore conscience is a power.
"," Further, nothing is a subject of sin, except a power of the
 soul. But conscience is a subject of sin; for it is said of some that
 ""their mind and conscience are defiled"" (Titus 1:15). Therefore it
 seems that conscience is a power.
"," Further, conscience must of necessity be either an act, a
 habit, or a power. But it is not an act; for thus it would not always
 exist in man. Nor is it a habit; for conscience is not one thing but
 many, since we are directed in our actions by many habits of
 knowledge. Therefore conscience is a power.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Conscience is called a spirit, so far as spirit is the
 same as mind; because conscience is a certain pronouncement of the
 mind.
"," The conscience is said to be defiled, not as a subject,
 but as the thing known is in knowledge; so far as someone knows he is
 defiled.
"," Although an act does not always remain in itself, yet
 it always remains in its cause, which is power and habit. Now all the
 habits by which conscience is formed, although many, nevertheless
 have their efficacy from one first habit, the habit of first

 reason, this habit is sometimes called conscience, as we have said
 above.

","Whether the Appetite Is a Special Power of the Soul?
"," It would seem that the appetite is not a special power
 of the soul. For no power of the soul is to be assigned for those
 things which are common to animate and to inanimate things. But
 appetite is common to animate and inanimate things: since ""all desire
 good,"" as the Philosopher says (Ethic. i, 1). Therefore the appetite
 is not a special power of the soul.
"," Further, powers are differentiated by their objects. But what
 we desire is the same as what we know. Therefore the appetitive power
 is not distinct from the apprehensive power.
"," Further, the common is not divided from the proper. But each
 power of the soul desires some particular desirable thing--namely its
 own suitable object. Therefore, with regard to this object which is
 the desirable in general, we should not assign some particular power
 distinct from the others, called the appetitive power.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Appetite is found in things which have knowledge, above
 the common manner in which it is found in all things, as we have said
 above. Therefore it is necessary to assign to the soul a particular
 power.
"," What is apprehended and what is desired are the same in
 reality, but differ in aspect: for a thing is apprehended as
 something sensible or intelligible, whereas it is desired as suitable
 or good. Now, it is diversity of aspect in the objects, and not
 material diversity, which demands a diversity of powers.
"," Each power of the soul is a form or nature, and has a
 natural inclination to something. Wherefore each power desires by the
 natural appetite that object which is suitable to itself. Above which
 natural appetite is the animal appetite, which follows the
 apprehension, and by which something is desired not as suitable to
 this or that power, such as sight for seeing, or sound for hearing;
 but simply as suitable to the animal.

","Whether the Sensitive and Intellectual Appetites Are Distinct Powers?
"," It would seem that the sensitive and intellectual
 appetites are not distinct powers. For powers are not differentiated
 by accidental differences, as we have seen above (Q. 77, A. 3). But
 it is accidental to the appetible object whether it be apprehended by
 the sense or by the intellect. Therefore the sensitive and
 intellectual appetites are not distinct powers.
"," Further, intellectual knowledge is of universals; and so it
 is distinct from sensitive knowledge, which is of individual things.
 But there is no place for this distinction in the appetitive part:
 for since the appetite is a movement of the soul to individual
 things, seemingly every act of the appetite regards an individual
 thing. Therefore the intellectual appetite is not distinguished from
 the sensitive.
"," Further, as under the apprehensive power, the appetitive is
 subordinate as a lower power, so also is the motive power. But the
 motive power which in man follows the intellect is not distinct from
 the motive power which in animals follows sense. Therefore, for a
 like reason, neither is there distinction in the appetitive part.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," It is not accidental to the thing desired to be
 apprehended by the sense or the intellect; on the contrary, this
 belongs to it by its nature; for the appetible does not move the
 appetite except as it is apprehended. Wherefore differences in the
 thing apprehended are of themselves differences of the appetible. And
 so the appetitive powers are distinct according to the distinction of
 the things apprehended, as their proper objects.
"," The intellectual appetite, though it tends to
 individual things which exist outside the soul, yet tends to them as
 standing under the universal; as when it desires something because it
 is good. Wherefore the Philosopher says (Rhetoric. ii, 4) that hatred
 can regard a universal, as when ""we hate every kind of thief."" In the
 same way by the intellectual appetite we may desire the immaterial
 good, which is not apprehended by sense, such as knowledge, virtue,
 and suchlike.

","Whether Sensuality Is Only Appetitive?
"," It would seem that sensuality is not only appetitive,
 but also cognitive. For Augustine says (De Trin. xii, 12) that ""the
 sensual movement of the soul which is directed to the bodily senses
 is common to us and beasts."" But the bodily senses belong to the
 apprehensive powers. Therefore sensuality is a cognitive power.
"," Further, things which come under one division seem to be
 of one genus. But Augustine (De Trin. xii, 12) divides sensuality
 against the higher and lower reason, which belong to knowledge.
 Therefore sensuality also is apprehensive.
"," Further, in man's temptations sensuality stands in the place
 of the ""serpent."" But in the temptation of our first parents, the
 serpent presented himself as one giving information and proposing
 sin, which belong to the cognitive power. Therefore sensuality is a
 cognitive power.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," By saying that the sensual movement of the soul is
 directed to the bodily senses, Augustine does not give us to
 understand that the bodily senses are included in sensuality, but
 rather that the movement of sensuality is a certain inclination to
 the bodily senses, since we desire things which are apprehended
 through the bodily senses. And thus the bodily senses appertain to
 sensuality as a preamble.
"," Sensuality is divided against higher and lower
 reason, as having in common with them the act of movement: for the
 apprehensive power, to which belong the higher and lower reason,
 is a motive power; as is appetite, to which appertains sensuality.
"," The serpent not only showed and proposed sin, but
 also incited to the commission of sin. And in this, sensuality is
 signified by the serpent.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
402,"[I, Q. 81, Art. 2]
","Whether the Sensitive Appetite Is Divided into the Irascible and
"," It would seem that the sensitive appetite is not divided
 into the irascible and concupiscible as distinct powers. For the same
 power of the soul regards both sides of a contrariety, as sight
 regards both black and white, according to the Philosopher (De Anima
 ii, 11). But suitable and harmful are contraries. Since, then, the
 concupiscible power regards what is suitable, while the irascible is
 concerned with what is harmful, it seems that irascible and
 concupiscible are the same power in the soul.
"," Further, the sensitive appetite regards only what is suitable
 according to the senses. But such is the object of the concupiscible
 power. Therefore there is no sensitive appetite differing from the
 concupiscible.
"," Further, hatred is in the irascible part: for Jerome says on
 Matt. 13:33: ""We ought to have the hatred of vice in the irascible
 power."" But hatred is contrary to love, and is in the concupiscible
 part. Therefore the concupiscible and irascible are the same powers.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The concupiscible power regards both what is suitable
 and what is unsuitable. But the object of the irascible power is to
 resist the onslaught of the unsuitable.
"," As in the apprehensive powers of the sensitive part
 there is an estimative power, which perceives those things which do
 not impress the senses, as we have said above (Q. 78, A. 2); so also
 in the sensitive appetite there is a certain appetitive power which
 regards something as suitable, not because it pleases the senses, but
 because it is useful to the animal for self-defense: and this is the
 irascible power.
"," Hatred belongs simply to the concupiscible appetite:
 but by reason of the strife which arises from hatred, it may belong
 to the irascible appetite.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
403,"[I, Q. 81, Art. 3]
","Whether the irascible and concupiscible appetites obey reason?
"," It would seem that the irascible and concupiscible
 appetites do not obey reason. For irascible and concupiscible are
 parts of sensuality. But sensuality does not obey reason, wherefore
 it is signified by the serpent, as Augustine says (De Trin. xii,
 12,13). Therefore the irascible and concupiscible appetites do not
 obey reason.
"," Further, what obeys a certain thing does not resist it. But
 the irascible and concupiscible appetites resist reason: according to
 the Apostle (Rom. 7:23): ""I see another law in my members fighting
 against the law of my mind."" Therefore the irascible and
 concupiscible appetites do not obey reason.
"," Further, as the appetitive power is inferior to the rational
 part of the soul, so also is the sensitive power. But the sensitive
 part of the soul does not obey reason: for we neither hear nor see
 just when we wish. Therefore, in like manner, neither do the powers
 of the sensitive appetite, the irascible and concupiscible, obey
 reason.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Sensuality is signified by the serpent, in what is
 proper to it as a sensitive power. But the irascible and
 concupiscible powers denominate the sensitive appetite rather on the
 part of the act, to which they are led by the reason, as we have said.
"," As the Philosopher says (Polit. i, 2): ""We observe in
 an animal a despotic and a politic principle: for the soul dominates
 the body by a despotic power; but the intellect dominates the
 appetite by a politic and royal power."" For a power is called
 despotic whereby a man rules his slaves, who have not the right to
 resist in any way the orders of the one that commands them, since
 they have nothing of their own. But that power is called politic and
 royal by which a man rules over free subjects, who, though subject
 to the government of the ruler, have nevertheless something of their
 own, by reason of which they can resist the orders of him who
 commands. And so, the soul is said to rule the body by a despotic
 power, because the members of the body cannot in any way resist the
 sway of the soul, but at the soul's command both hand and foot, and
 whatever member is naturally moved by voluntary movement, are moved
 at once. But the intellect or reason is said to rule the irascible
 and concupiscible by a politic power: because the sensitive appetite
 has something of its own, by virtue whereof it can resist the
 commands of reason. For the sensitive appetite is naturally moved,
 not only by the estimative power in other animals, and in man by the
 cogitative power which the universal reason guides, but also by the
 imagination and sense. Whence it is that we experience that the
 irascible and concupiscible powers do resist reason, inasmuch as we
 sense or imagine something pleasant, which reason forbids, or
 unpleasant, which reason commands. And so from the fact that the
 irascible and concupiscible resist reason in something, we must not
 conclude that they do not obey.
"," The exterior senses require for action exterior
 sensible things, whereby they are affected, and the presence of which
 is not ruled by reason. But the interior powers, both appetitive and
 apprehensive, do not require exterior things. Therefore they are
 subject to the command of reason, which can not only incite or modify
 the affections of the appetitive power, but can also form the
 phantasms of the imagination.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
404,"[I, Q. 82, Art. 1]
","Whether the Will Desires Something of Necessity?
"," It would seem that the will desires nothing of
 necessity. For Augustine says (De Civ. Dei v, 10) that it anything
 is necessary, it is not voluntary. But whatever the will desires is
 voluntary. Therefore nothing that the will desires is desired of
 necessity.
"," Further, the rational powers, according to the Philosopher
 (Metaph. viii, 2), extend to opposite things. But the will is a
 rational power, because, as he says (De Anima iii, 9), ""the will is
 in the reason."" Therefore the will extends to opposite things, and
 therefore it is determined to nothing of necessity.
"," Further, by the will we are masters of our own actions. But
 we are not masters of that which is of necessity. Therefore the act
 of the will cannot be necessitated.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The words of Augustine are to be understood of the
 necessity of coercion. But natural necessity ""does not take away
 the liberty of the will,"" as he says himself (De Civ. Dei v, 10).
"," The will, so far as it desires a thing naturally,
 corresponds rather to the intellect as regards natural principles
 than to the reason, which extends to opposite things. Wherefore in
 this respect it is rather an intellectual than a rational power.
"," We are masters of our own actions by reason of our
 being able to choose this or that. But choice regards not the end,
 but ""the means to the end,"" as the Philosopher says (Ethic. iii, 9).
 Wherefore the desire of the ultimate end does not regard those
 actions of which we are masters.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
405,"[I, Q. 82, Art. 2]
","Whether the Will Desires of Necessity, Whatever It Desires?
"," It would seem that the will desires all things of
 necessity, whatever it desires. For Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv)
 that ""evil is outside the scope of the will."" Therefore the will
 tends of necessity to the good which is proposed to it.
"," Further, the object of the will is compared to the will as
 the mover to the thing movable. But the movement of the movable
 necessarily follows the mover. Therefore it seems that the will's
 object moves it of necessity.
"," Further, as the thing apprehended by sense is the object of
 the sensitive appetite, so the thing apprehended by the intellect is
 the object of the intellectual appetite, which is called the will.
 But what is apprehended by the sense moves the sensitive appetite of
 necessity: for Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. ix, 14) that ""animals
 are moved by things seen."" Therefore it seems that whatever is
 apprehended by the intellect moves the will of necessity.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The will can tend to nothing except under the aspect of
 good. But because good is of many kinds, for this reason the will is
 not of necessity determined to one.
"," The mover, then, of necessity causes movement in the
 thing movable, when the power of the mover exceeds the thing movable,
 so that its entire capacity is subject to the mover. But as the
 capacity of the will regards the universal and perfect good, its
 capacity is not subjected to any individual good. And therefore it is
 not of necessity moved by it.
"," The sensitive power does not compare different things
 with each other, as reason does: but it simply apprehends some one
 thing. Therefore, according to that one thing, it moves the sensitive
 appetite in a determinate way. But the reason is a power that
 compares several things together: therefore from several things the
 intellectual appetite--that is, the will--may be moved; but not of
 necessity from one thing.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
406,"[I, Q. 82, Art. 3]
","Whether the Will Is a Higher Power Than the Intellect?
"," It would seem that the will is a higher power than the
 intellect. For the object of the will is good and the end. But the
 end is the first and highest cause. Therefore the will is the first
 and highest power.
"," Further, in the order of natural things we observe a progress
 from imperfect things to perfect. And this also appears in the powers
 of the soul: for sense precedes the intellect, which is more noble.
 Now the act of the will, in the natural order, follows the act of the
 intellect. Therefore the will is a more noble and perfect power than
 the intellect.
"," Further, habits are proportioned to their powers, as
 perfections to what they make perfect. But the habit which perfects
 the will--namely, charity--is more noble than the habits which
 perfect the intellect: for it is written (1 Cor. 13:2): ""If I should
 know all mysteries, and if I should have all faith, and have not
 charity, I am nothing."" Therefore the will is a higher power than
 the intellect.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The aspect of causality is perceived by comparing one
 thing to another, and in such a comparison the idea of good is found
 to be nobler: but truth signifies something more absolute, and
 extends to the idea of good itself: wherefore even good is something
 true. But, again, truth is something good: forasmuch as the intellect
 is a thing, and truth its end. And among other ends this is the most
 excellent: as also is the intellect among the other powers.
"," What precedes in order of generation and time is less
 perfect: for in one and in the same thing potentiality precedes act,
 and imperfection precedes perfection. But what precedes absolutely
 and in the order of nature is more perfect: for thus act precedes
 potentiality. And in this way the intellect precedes the will, as the
 motive power precedes the thing movable, and as the active precedes
 the passive; for good which is understood moves the will.
"," This reason is verified of the will as compared with
 what is above the soul. For charity is the virtue by which we love
 God.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
407,"[I, Q. 82, Art. 4]
","Whether the Will Moves the Intellect?
"," It would seem that the will does not move the intellect.
 For what moves excels and precedes what is moved, because what moves
 is an agent, and ""the agent is nobler than the patient,"" as Augustine
 says (Gen. ad lit. xii, 16), and the Philosopher (De Anima iii, 5).
 But the intellect excels and precedes the will, as we have said above
 (A. 3). Therefore the will does not move the intellect.
"," Further, what moves is not moved by what is moved, except
 perhaps accidentally. But the intellect moves the will, because the
 good apprehended by the intellect moves without being moved; whereas
 the appetite moves and is moved. Therefore the intellect is not moved
 by the will.
"," Further, we can will nothing but what we understand. If,
 therefore, in order to understand, the will moves by willing to
 understand, that act of the will must be preceded by another act of
 the intellect, and this act of the intellect by another act of the
 will, and so on indefinitely, which is impossible. Therefore the will
 does not move the intellect.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The intellect may be considered in two ways: as
 apprehensive of universal being and truth, and as a thing and a
 particular power having a determinate act. In like manner also the
 will may be considered in two ways: according to the common nature of
 its object--that is to say, as appetitive of universal good--and as
 a determinate power of the soul having a determinate act. If,
 therefore, the intellect and the will be compared with one another
 according to the universality of their respective objects, then, as
 we have said above (A. 3), the intellect is simply higher and nobler
 than the will. If, however, we take the intellect as regards the
 common nature of its object and the will as a determinate power, then
 again the intellect is higher and nobler than the will, because under
 the notion of being and truth is contained both the will itself, and
 its act, and its object. Wherefore the intellect understands the will,
 and its act, and its object, just as it understands other species of
 things, as stone or wood, which are contained in the common notion of
 being and truth. But if we consider the will as regards the common
 nature of its object, which is good, and the intellect as a thing and
 a special power; then the intellect itself, and its act, and its
 object, which is truth, each of which is some species of good, are
 contained under the common notion of good. And in this way the will is
 higher than the intellect, and can move it. From this we can easily
 understand why these powers include one another in their acts, because
 the intellect understands that the will wills, and the will wills the
 intellect to understand. In the same way good is contained in truth,
 inasmuch as it is an understood truth, and truth in good, inasmuch as
 it is a desired good.
"," The intellect moves the will in one sense, and the will
 moves the intellect in another, as we have said above.
"," There is no need to go on indefinitely, but we must
 stop at the intellect as preceding all the rest. For every movement
 of the will must be preceded by apprehension, whereas every
 apprehension is not preceded by an act of the will; but the principle
 of counselling and understanding is an intellectual principle higher
 than our intellect--namely, God--as also Aristotle says (Eth.
 Eudemic. vii, 14), and in this way he explains that there is no need
 to proceed indefinitely.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
408,"[I, Q. 82, Art. 5]
","Whether We Should Distinguish Irascible and Concupiscible Parts in
"," It would seem that we ought to distinguish irascible and
 concupiscible parts in the superior appetite, which is the will. For
 the concupiscible power is so called from ""concupiscere"" (to desire),
 and the irascible part from ""irasci"" (to be angry). But there is a
 concupiscence which cannot belong to the sensitive appetite, but only
 to the intellectual, which is the will; as the concupiscence of
 wisdom, of which it is said (Wis. 6:21): ""The concupiscence of wisdom
 bringeth to the eternal kingdom."" There is also a certain anger which
 cannot belong to the sensitive appetite, but only to the intellectual;
 as when our anger is directed against vice. Wherefore Jerome
 commenting on Matt. 13:33 warns us ""to have the hatred of vice in the
 irascible part."" Therefore we should distinguish irascible and
 concupiscible parts of the intellectual soul as well as in the
 sensitive.
"," Further, as is commonly said, charity is in the
 concupiscible, and hope in the irascible part. But they cannot be in
 the sensitive appetite, because their objects are not sensible, but
 intellectual. Therefore we must assign an irascible and concupiscible
 power to the intellectual part.
"," Further, it is said (De Spiritu et Anima) that ""the soul
 has these powers""--namely, the irascible, concupiscible, and
 rational--""before it is united to the body."" But no power of the
 sensitive part belongs to the soul alone, but to the soul and body
 united, as we have said above (Q. 78, AA. 5, 8). Therefore the
 irascible and concupiscible powers are in the will, which is the
 intellectual appetite.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Love, concupiscence, and the like can be understood in
 two ways. Sometimes they are taken as passions--arising, that is,
 with a certain commotion of the soul. And thus they are commonly
 understood, and in this sense they are only in the sensitive
 appetite. They may, however, be taken in another way, as far as they
 are simple affections without passion or commotion of the soul, and
 thus they are acts of the will. And in this sense, too, they are
 attributed to the angels and to God. But if taken in this sense, they
 do not belong to different powers, but only to one power, which is
 called the will.
"," The will itself may be said to [be] irascible, as far
 as it wills to repel evil, not from any sudden movement of a passion,
 but from a judgment of the reason. And in the same way the will may
 be said to be concupiscible on account of its desire for good. And
 thus in the irascible and concupiscible are charity and hope--that
 is, in the will as ordered to such acts. And in this way, too, we may
 understand the words quoted (De Spiritu et Anima); that the irascible
 and concupiscible powers are in the soul before it is united to the
 body (as long as we understand priority of nature, and not of time),
 although there is no need to have faith in what that book says.
 Whence the answer to the third objection is clear.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
409,"[I, Q. 83, Art. 1]
","Whether Man Has Free-Will?
"," It would seem that man has not free-will. For whoever
 has free-will does what he wills. But man does not what he wills; for
 it is written (Rom. 7:19): ""For the good which I will I do not, but
 the evil which I will not, that I do."" Therefore man has not
 free-will.
"," Further, whoever has free-will has in his power to will or
 not to will, to do or not to do. But this is not in man's power: for
 it is written (Rom. 9:16): ""It is not of him that willeth""--namely,
 to will--""nor of him that runneth""--namely, to run. Therefore man has
 not free-will.
"," Further, what is ""free is cause of itself,"" as the
 Philosopher says (Metaph. i, 2). Therefore what is moved by another
 is not free. But God moves the will, for it is written (Prov. 21:1):
 ""The heart of the king is in the hand of the Lord; whithersoever He
 will He shall turn it"" and (Phil. 2:13): ""It is God Who worketh in
 you both to will and to accomplish."" Therefore man has not free-will.
"," Further, whoever has free-will is master of his own actions.
 But man is not master of his own actions: for it is written (Jer.
 10:23): ""The way of a man is not his: neither is it in a man to
 walk."" Therefore man has not free-will.
"," Further, the Philosopher says (Ethic. iii, 5): ""According as
 each one is, such does the end seem to him."" But it is not in our
 power to be of one quality or another; for this comes to us from
 nature. Therefore it is natural to us to follow some particular end,
 and therefore we are not free in so doing.
",,,,,,,,,,,,," As we have said above (Q. 81, A. 3, ad 2), the
 sensitive appetite, though it obeys the reason, yet in a given case
 can resist by desiring what the reason forbids. This is therefore
 the good which man does not when he wishes--namely, ""not to desire
 against reason,"" as Augustine says.
"," Those words of the Apostle are not to be taken as
 though man does not wish or does not run of his free-will, but
 because the free-will is not sufficient thereto unless it be moved
 and helped by God.
"," Free-will is the cause of its own movement, because by
 his free-will man moves himself to act. But it does not of necessity
 belong to liberty that what is free should be the first cause of
 itself, as neither for one thing to be cause of another need it be
 the first cause. God, therefore, is the first cause, Who moves causes
 both natural and voluntary. And just as by moving natural causes He
 does not prevent their acts being natural, so by moving voluntary
 causes He does not deprive their actions of being voluntary: but
 rather is He the cause of this very thing in them; for He operates
 in each thing according to its own nature.
"," ""Man's way"" is said ""not to be his"" in the execution of
 his choice, wherein he may be impeded, whether he will or not. The
 choice itself, however, is in us, but presupposes the help of God.
"," Quality in man is of two kinds: natural and
 adventitious. Now the natural quality may be in the intellectual
 part, or in the body and its powers. From the very fact, therefore,
 that man is such by virtue of a natural quality which is in the
 intellectual part, he naturally desires his last end, which is
 happiness. Which desire, indeed, is a natural desire, and is not
 subject to free-will, as is clear from what we have said above (Q.
 82, AA. 1, 2). But on the part of the body and its powers man may be
 such by virtue of a natural quality, inasmuch as he is of such a
 temperament or disposition due to any impression whatever produced by
 corporeal causes, which cannot affect the intellectual part, since it
 is not the act of a corporeal organ. And such as a man is by virtue
 of a corporeal quality, such also does his end seem to him, because
 from such a disposition a man is inclined to choose or reject
 something. But these inclinations are subject to the judgment of
 reason, which the lower appetite obeys, as we have said (Q. 81, A.
 3). Wherefore this is in no way prejudicial to free-will.
",,,,,,,,,,,
410,"[I, Q. 83, Art. 2]
","Whether Free-Will Is a Power?
"," It would seem that free-will is not a power. For
 free-will is nothing but a free judgment. But judgment denominates an
 act, not a power. Therefore free-will is not a power.
"," Further, free-will is defined as ""the faculty of the will and
 reason."" But faculty denominates a facility of power, which is due to
 a habit. Therefore free-will is a habit. Moreover Bernard says (De
 Gratia et Lib. Arb. 1,2) that free-will is ""the soul's habit of
 disposing of itself."" Therefore it is not a power.
"," Further, no natural power is forfeited through sin. But
 free-will is forfeited through sin; for Augustine says that ""man, by
 abusing free-will, loses both it and himself."" Therefore free-will is
 not a power.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," It is not unusual for a power to be named from its act.
 And so from this act, which is a free judgment, is named the power
 which is the principle of this act. Otherwise, if free-will
 denominated an act, it would not always remain in man.
"," Faculty sometimes denominates a power ready for
 operation, and in this sense faculty is used in the definition of
 free-will. But Bernard takes habit, not as divided against power, but
 as signifying a certain aptitude by which a man has some sort of
 relation to an act. And this may be both by a power and by a habit:
 for by a power man is, as it were, empowered to do the action, and by
 the habit he is apt to act well or ill.
"," Man is said to have lost free-will by falling into sin,
 not as to natural liberty, which is freedom from coercion, but as
 regards freedom from fault and unhappiness. Of this we shall treat
 later in the treatise on Morals in the second part of this work
 (I-II, Q. 85, seqq.; Q. 109).
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
411,"[I, Q. 83, Art. 3]
","Whether Free-will Is an Appetitive Power?
"," It would seem that free-will is not an appetitive, but
 a cognitive power. For Damascene (De Fide Orth. ii, 27) says that
 ""free-will straightway accompanies the rational nature."" But reason
 is a cognitive power. Therefore free-will is a cognitive power.
"," Further, free-will is so called as though it were a free
 judgment. But to judge is an act of a cognitive power. Therefore
 free-will is a cognitive power.
"," Further, the principal function of free-will is to choose.
 But choice seems to belong to knowledge, because it implies a certain
 comparison of one thing to another, which belongs to the cognitive
 power. Therefore free-will is a cognitive power.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The appetitive powers accompany the apprehensive, and
 in this sense Damascene says that free-will straightway accompanies
 the rational power.
"," Judgment, as it were, concludes and terminates counsel.
 Now counsel is terminated, first, by the judgment of reason;
 secondly, by the acceptation of the appetite: whence the Philosopher
 (Ethic. iii, 3) says that, ""having formed a judgment by counsel, we
 desire in accordance with that counsel."" And in this sense choice
 itself is a judgment from which free-will takes its name.
"," This comparison which is implied in the choice belongs
 to the preceding counsel, which is an act of reason. For though the
 appetite does not make comparisons, yet forasmuch as it is moved by
 the apprehensive power which does compare, it has some likeness of
 comparison by choosing one in preference to another.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
412,"[I, Q. 83, Art. 4]
","Whether Free-will Is a Power Distinct from the Will?
"," It would seem that free-will is a power distinct from the
 will. For Damascene says (De Fide Orth. ii, 22) that thelesis is one
 thing and boulesis another. But thelesis is the will, while
 boulesis seems to be the free-will, because boulesis, according to
 him, is will as concerning an object by way of comparison between two
 things. Therefore it seems that free-will is a distinct power from the
 will.
"," Further, powers are known by their acts. But choice, which is
 the act of free-will, is distinct from the act of willing, because
 ""the act of the will regards the end, whereas choice regards the
 means to the end"" (Ethic. iii, 2). Therefore free-will is a distinct
 power from the will.
"," Further, the will is the intellectual appetite. But in the
 intellect there are two powers--the active and the passive.
 Therefore, also on the part of the intellectual appetite, there must
 be another power besides the will. And this, seemingly, can only be
 free-will. Therefore free-will is a distinct power from the will.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Boulesis is distinct from thelesis on account of a
 distinction, not of powers, but of acts.
"," Choice and will--that is, the act of willing--are
 different acts: yet they belong to the same power, as also to
 understand and to reason, as we have said.
"," The intellect is compared to the will as moving the
 will. And therefore there is no need to distinguish in the will an
 active and a passive will.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
413,"[I, Q. 84, Art. 1]
","Whether the Soul Knows Bodies Through the Intellect?
"," It would seem that the soul does not know bodies through
 the intellect. For Augustine says (Soliloq. ii, 4) that ""bodies cannot
 be understood by the intellect; nor indeed anything corporeal unless
 it can be perceived by the senses."" He says also (Gen. ad lit. xii,
 24) that intellectual vision is of those things that are in the soul
 by their essence. But such are not bodies. Therefore the soul cannot
 know bodies through the intellect.
"," Further, as sense is to the intelligible, so is the intellect
 to the sensible. But the soul can by no means, through the senses,
 understand spiritual things, which are intelligible. Therefore by no
 means can it, through the intellect, know bodies, which are sensible.
"," Further, the intellect is concerned with things that are
 necessary and unchangeable. But all bodies are mobile and changeable.
 Therefore the soul cannot know bodies through the intellect.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," These words of Augustine are to be understood as
 referring to the medium of intellectual knowledge, and not to its
 object. For the intellect knows bodies by understanding them, not
 indeed through bodies, nor through material and corporeal species;
 but through immaterial and intelligible species, which can be in the
 soul by their own essence.
"," As Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xxii, 29), it is not
 correct to say that as the sense knows only bodies so the intellect
 knows only spiritual things; for it follows that God and the angels
 would not know corporeal things. The reason of this diversity is that
 the lower power does not extend to those things that belong to the
 higher power; whereas the higher power operates in a more excellent
 manner those things which belong to the lower power.
"," Every movement presupposes something immovable: for
 when a change of quality occurs, the substance remains unmoved; and
 when there is a change of substantial form, matter remains unmoved.
 Moreover the various conditions of mutable things are themselves
 immovable; for instance, though Socrates be not always sitting, yet
 it is an immovable truth that whenever he does sit he remains in one
 place. For this reason there is nothing to hinder our having an
 immovable science of movable things.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
414,"[I, Q. 84, Art. 2]
","Whether the Soul Understands Corporeal Things Through Its Essence?
"," It would seem that the soul understands corporeal things
 through its essence. For Augustine says (De Trin. x, 5) that the soul
 ""collects and lays hold of the images of bodies which are formed in
 the soul and of the soul: for in forming them it gives them something
 of its own substance."" But the soul understands bodies by images of
 bodies. Therefore the soul knows bodies through its essence, which it
 employs for the formation of such images, and from which it forms
 them.
"," Further, the Philosopher says (De Anima iii, 8) that ""the
 soul, after a fashion, is everything."" Since, therefore, like is known
 by like, it seems that the soul knows corporeal things through itself.
"," Further, the soul is superior to corporeal creatures. Now
 lower things are in higher things in a more eminent way than in
 themselves, as Dionysius says (Coel. Hier. xii). Therefore all
 corporeal creatures exist in a more excellent way in the soul than in
 themselves. Therefore the soul can know corporeal creatures through
 its essence.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Augustine in that passage is speaking of an imaginary
 vision, which takes place through the image of bodies. To the
 formation of such images the soul gives part of its substance, just
 as a subject is given in order to be informed by some form. In this
 way the soul makes such images from itself; not that the soul or some
 part of the soul be turned into this or that image; but just as we
 say that a body is made into something colored because of its being
 informed with color. That this is the sense, is clear from what
 follows. For he says that the soul ""keeps something""--namely, not
 informed with such image--""which is able freely to judge of the
 species of these images"": and that this is the ""mind"" or ""intellect.""
 And he says that the part which is informed with these
 images--namely, the imagination--is ""common to us and beasts.""
"," Aristotle did not hold that the soul is actually
 composed of all things, as did the earlier philosophers; he said that
 the soul is all things, ""after a fashion,"" forasmuch as it is in
 potentiality to all--through the senses, to all things
 sensible--through the intellect, to all things intelligible.
"," Every creature has a finite and determinate essence.
 Wherefore although the essence of the higher creature has a certain
 likeness to the lower creature, forasmuch as they have something in
 common generically, yet it has not a complete likeness thereof,
 because it is determined to a certain species other than the species
 of the lower creature. But the Divine Essence is a perfect likeness
 of all, whatsoever may be found to exist in things created, being the
 universal principle of all.

","Whether the Soul Understands All Things Through Innate Species?
"," It would seem that the soul understands all things
 through innate species. For Gregory says, in a homily for the
 Ascension (xxix in Ev.), that ""man has understanding in common with
 the angels."" But angels understand all things through innate species:
 wherefore in the book De Causis it is said that ""every intelligence
 is full of forms."" Therefore the soul also has innate species of
 things, by means of which it understands corporeal things.
"," Further, the intellectual soul is more excellent than
 corporeal primary matter. But primary matter was created by God under
 the forms to which it has potentiality. Therefore much more is the
 intellectual soul created by God under intelligible species. And so
 the soul understands corporeal things through innate species.
"," Further, no one can answer the truth except concerning what
 he knows. But even a person untaught and devoid of acquired
 knowledge, answers the truth to every question if put to him in
 orderly fashion, as we find related in the Meno (xv seqq.) of Plato,
 concerning a certain individual. Therefore we have some knowledge of
 things even before we acquire knowledge; which would not be the case
 unless we had innate species. Therefore the soul understands
 corporeal things through innate species.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Man indeed has intelligence in common with the angels,
 but not in the same degree of perfection: just as the lower grades of
 bodies, which merely exist, according to Gregory (Homily on
 Ascension, xxix In Ev.), have not the same degree of perfection as
 the higher bodies. For the matter of the lower bodies is not totally
 completed by its form, but is in potentiality to forms which it has
 not: whereas the matter of heavenly bodies is totally completed by
 its form, so that it is not in potentiality to any other form, as we
 have said above (Q. 66, A. 2). In the same way the angelic intellect
 is perfected by intelligible species, in accordance with its nature;
 whereas the human intellect is in potentiality to such species.
"," Primary matter has substantial being through its form,
 consequently it had need to be created under some form: else it would
 not be in act. But when once it exists under one form it is in
 potentiality to others. On the other hand, the intellect does not
 receive substantial being through the intelligible species; and
 therefore there is no comparison.
"," If questions be put in an orderly fashion they proceed
 from universal self-evident principles to what is particular. Now by
 such a process knowledge is produced in the mind of the learner.
 Wherefore when he answers the truth to a subsequent question, this is
 not because he had knowledge previously, but because he thus learns
 for the first time. For it matters not whether the teacher proceed
 from universal principles to conclusions by questioning or by
 asserting; for in either case the mind of the listener is assured of
 what follows by that which preceded.

","Whether the Intelligible Species Are Derived by the Soul from Certain
"," It would seem that the intelligible species are derived
 by the soul from some separate forms. For whatever is such by
 participation is caused by what is such essentially; for instance,
 that which is on fire is reduced to fire as the cause thereof. But
 the intellectual soul forasmuch as it is actually understanding,
 participates the thing understood: for, in a way, the intellect in
 act is the thing understood in act. Therefore what in itself and in
 its essence is understood in act, is the cause that the intellectual
 soul actually understands. Now that which in its essence is actually
 understood is a form existing without matter. Therefore the
 intelligible species, by which the soul understands, are caused by
 some separate forms.
"," Further, the intelligible is to the intellect, as the
 sensible is to the sense. But the sensible species which are in the
 senses, and by which we sense, are caused by the sensible object
 which exists actually outside the soul. Therefore the intelligible
 species, by which our intellect understands, are caused by some
 things actually intelligible, existing outside the soul. But these
 can be nothing else than forms separate from matter. Therefore the
 intelligible forms of our intellect are derived from some separate
 substances.
"," Further, whatever is in potentiality is reduced to act by
 something actual. If, therefore, our intellect, previously in
 potentiality, afterwards actually understands, this must needs be
 caused by some intellect which is always in act. But this is a
 separate intellect. Therefore the intelligible species, by which we
 actually understand, are caused by some separate substances.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The intelligible species which are participated by our
 intellect are reduced, as to their first cause, to a first principle
 which is by its essence intelligible--namely, God. But they proceed
 from that principle by means of the sensible forms and material
 things, from which we gather knowledge, as Dionysius says (Div. Nom.
 vii).
"," Material things, as to the being which they have
 outside the soul, may be actually sensible, but not actually
 intelligible. Wherefore there is no comparison between sense and
 intellect.
"," Our passive intellect is reduced from potentiality to
 act by some being in act, that is, by the active intellect, which is
 a power of the soul, as we have said (Q. 79, A. 4); and not by a
 separate intelligence, as proximate cause, although perchance as
 remote cause.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
417,"[I, Q. 84, Art. 5]
","Whether the Intellectual Soul Knows Material Things in the Eternal
"," It would seem that the intellectual soul does not know
 material things in the eternal types. For that in which anything is
 known must itself be known more and previously. But the intellectual
 soul of man, in the present state of life, does not know the eternal
 types: for it does not know God in Whom the eternal types exist, but
 is ""united to God as to the unknown,"" as Dionysius says (Myst.
 Theolog. i). Therefore the soul does not know all in the eternal
 types.
"," Further, it is written (Rom. 1:20) that ""the invisible things
 of God are clearly seen . . . by the things that are made."" But among
 the invisible things of God are the eternal types. Therefore the
 eternal types are known through creatures and not the converse.
"," Further, the eternal types are nothing else but ideas, for
 Augustine says (QQ. 83, qu. 46) that ""ideas are permanent types
 existing in the Divine mind."" If therefore we say that the
 intellectual soul knows all things in the eternal types, we come back
 to the opinion of Plato who said that all knowledge is derived from
 them.

418,"[I, Q. 84, Art. 6]
","Whether Intellectual Knowledge Is Derived from Sensible Things?
"," It would seem that intellectual knowledge is not derived
 from sensible things. For Augustine says (QQ. 83, qu. 9) that ""we
 cannot expect to learn the fulness of truth from the senses of the
 body."" This he proves in two ways. First, because ""whatever the
 bodily senses reach, is continually being changed; and what is never
 the same cannot be perceived."" Secondly, because, ""whatever we
 perceive by the body, even when not present to the senses, may be
 present to the imagination, as when we are asleep or angry: yet we
 cannot discern by the senses, whether what we perceive be the
 sensible object or the deceptive image thereof. Now nothing can be
 perceived which cannot be distinguished from its counterfeit."" And so
 he concludes that we cannot expect to learn the truth from the
 senses. But intellectual knowledge apprehends the truth. Therefore
 intellectual knowledge cannot be conveyed by the senses.
"," Further, Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. xii, 16): ""We must not
 think that the body can make any impression on the spirit, as though
 the spirit were to supply the place of matter in regard to the body's
 action; for that which acts is in every way more excellent than that
 which it acts on."" Whence he concludes that ""the body does not cause
 its image in the spirit, but the spirit causes it in itself.""
 Therefore intellectual knowledge is not derived from sensible things.
"," Further, an effect does not surpass the power of its cause.
 But intellectual knowledge extends beyond sensible things: for we
 understand some things which cannot be perceived by the senses.
 Therefore intellectual knowledge is not derived from sensible things.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Those words of Augustine mean that we must not expect
 the entire truth from the senses. For the light of the active
 intellect is needed, through which we achieve the unchangeable truth
 of changeable things, and discern things themselves from their
 likeness.
"," In this passage Augustine speaks not of intellectual
 but of imaginary knowledge. And since, according to the opinion of
 Plato, the imagination has an operation which belongs to the soul
 only, Augustine, in order to show that corporeal images are impressed
 on the imagination, not by bodies but by the soul, uses the same
 argument as Aristotle does in proving that the active intellect must
 be separate, namely, because ""the agent is more noble than the
 patient."" And without doubt, according to the above opinion, in the
 imagination there must needs be not only a passive but also an active
 power. But if we hold, according to the opinion of Aristotle, that
 the action of the imagination is an action of the ""composite,"" there
 is no difficulty; because the sensible body is more noble than the
 organ of the animal, in so far as it is compared to it as a being in
 act to a being in potentiality; even as the object actually colored
 is compared to the pupil which is potentially colored. It may,
 however, be said, although the first impression of the imagination is
 through the agency of the sensible, since ""fancy is movement produced
 in accordance with sensation"" (De Anima iii, 3), that nevertheless
 there is in man an operation which by synthesis and analysis forms
 images of various things, even of things not perceived by the senses.
 And Augustine's words may be taken in this sense.
"," Sensitive knowledge is not the entire cause of
 intellectual knowledge. And therefore it is not strange that
 intellectual knowledge should extend further than sensitive knowledge.

419,"[I, Q. 84, Art. 7]
","Whether the Intellect Can Actually Understand Through the
"," It would seem that the intellect can actually understand
 through the intelligible species of which it is possessed, without
 turning to the phantasms. For the intellect is made actual by the
 intelligible species by which it is informed. But if the intellect is
 in act, it understands. Therefore the intelligible species suffices
 for the intellect to understand actually, without turning to the
 phantasms.
"," Further, the imagination is more dependent on the senses
 than the intellect on the imagination. But the imagination can
 actually imagine in the absence of the sensible. Therefore much more
 can the intellect understand without turning to the phantasms.
"," There are no phantasms of incorporeal things: for the
 imagination does not transcend time and space. If, therefore, our
 intellect cannot understand anything actually without turning to the
 phantasms, it follows that it cannot understand anything incorporeal.
 Which is clearly false: for we understand truth, and God, and the
 angels.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The species preserved in the passive intellect exist
 there habitually when it does not understand them actually, as we
 have said above (Q. 79, A. 6). Wherefore for us to understand
 actually, the fact that the species are preserved does not suffice;
 we need further to make use of them in a manner befitting the things
 of which they are the species, which things are natures existing in
 individuals.
"," Even the phantasm is the likeness of an individual
 thing; wherefore the imagination does not need any further likeness
 of the individual, whereas the intellect does.
"," Incorporeal things, of which there are no phantasms,
 are known to us by comparison with sensible bodies of which there are
 phantasms. Thus we understand truth by considering a thing of which
 we possess the truth; and God, as Dionysius says (Div. Nom. i), we
 know as cause, by way of excess and by way of remotion. Other
 incorporeal substances we know, in the present state of life, only by
 way of remotion or by some comparison to corporeal things. And,
 therefore, when we understand something about these things, we need
 to turn to phantasms of bodies, although there are no phantasms of
 the things themselves.

420,"[I, Q. 84, Art. 8]
","Whether the Judgment of the Intellect Is Hindered Through Suspension
"," It would seem that the judgment of the intellect is not
 hindered by suspension of the sensitive powers. For the superior does
 not depend on the inferior. But the judgment of the intellect is
 higher than the senses. Therefore the judgment of the intellect is
 not hindered through suspension of the senses.
"," Further, to syllogize is an act of the intellect. But during
 sleep the senses are suspended, as is said in De Somn. et Vigil. i
 and yet it sometimes happens to us to syllogize while asleep.
 Therefore the judgment of the intellect is not hindered through
 suspension of the senses.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Although the intellect is superior to the senses,
 nevertheless in a manner it receives from the senses, and its first
 and principal objects are founded in sensible things. And therefore
 suspension of the senses necessarily involves a hindrance to the
 judgment of the intellect.
"," The senses are suspended in the sleeper through certain
 evaporations and the escape of certain exhalations, as we read in De
 Somn. et Vigil. iii. And, therefore, according to the amount of such
 evaporation, the senses are more or less suspended. For when the
 amount is considerable, not only are the senses suspended, but also
 the imagination, so that there are no phantasms; thus does it happen,
 especially when a man falls asleep after eating and drinking
 copiously. If, however, the evaporation be somewhat less, phantasms
 appear, but distorted and without sequence; thus it happens in a case
 of fever. And if the evaporation be still more attenuated, the
 phantasms will have a certain sequence: thus especially does it
 happen towards the end of sleep in sober men and those who are gifted
 with a strong imagination. If the evaporation be very slight, not
 only does the imagination retain its freedom, but also the common
 sense is partly freed; so that sometimes while asleep a man may judge
 that what he sees is a dream, discerning, as it were, between things,
 and their images. Nevertheless, the common sense remains partly
 suspended; and therefore, although it discriminates some images from
 the reality, yet is it always deceived in some particular. Therefore,
 while man is asleep, according as sense and imagination are free, so
 is the judgment of his intellect unfettered, though not entirely.
 Consequently, if a man syllogizes while asleep, when he wakes up he
 invariably recognizes a flaw in some respect.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
421,"[I, Q. 85, Art. 1]
","Whether Our Intellect Understands Corporeal and Material Things by
"," It would seem that our intellect does not understand
 corporeal and material things by abstraction from the phantasms. For
 the intellect is false if it understands an object otherwise than as
 it really is. Now the forms of material things do not exist as
 abstracted from the particular things represented by the phantasms.
 Therefore, if we understand material things by abstraction of the
 species from the phantasm, there will be error in the intellect.
"," Further, material things are those natural things which
 include matter in their definition. But nothing can be understood
 apart from that which enters into its definition. Therefore material
 things cannot be understood apart from matter. Now matter is the
 principle of individualization. Therefore material things cannot be
 understood by abstraction of the universal from the particular, which
 is the process whereby the intelligible species is abstracted from the
 phantasm.
"," Further, the Philosopher says (De Anima iii, 7) that the
 phantasm is to the intellectual soul what color is to the sight. But
 seeing is not caused by abstraction of species from color, but by
 color impressing itself on the sight. Therefore neither does the act
 of understanding take place by abstraction of something from the
 phantasm, but by the phantasm impressing itself on the intellect.
"," Further, the Philosopher says (De Anima iii, 5) there are
 two things in the intellectual soul--the passive intellect and the
 active intellect. But it does not belong to the passive intellect to
 abstract the intelligible species from the phantasm, but to receive
 them when abstracted. Neither does it seem to be the function of the
 active intellect, which is related to the phantasm, as light is to
 color; since light does not abstract anything from color, but rather
 streams on to it. Therefore in no way do we understand by abstraction
 from phantasms.
"," Further, the Philosopher (De Anima iii, 7) says that ""the
 intellect understands the species in the phantasm""; and not,
 therefore, by abstraction.
",,,,,,,,,,,,," Abstraction may occur in two ways: First, by way of
 composition and division; thus we may understand that one thing does
 not exist in some other, or that it is separate therefrom. Secondly,
 by way of simple and absolute consideration; thus we understand one
 thing without considering the other. Thus for the intellect to
 abstract one from another things which are not really abstract from
 one another, does, in the first mode of abstraction, imply falsehood.
 But, in the second mode of abstraction, for the intellect to abstract
 things which are not really abstract from one another, does not
 involve falsehood, as clearly appears in the case of the senses. For
 if we understood or said that color is not in a colored body, or that
 it is separate from it, there would be error in this opinion or
 assertion. But if we consider color and its properties, without
 reference to the apple which is colored; or if we express in word
 what we thus understand, there is no error in such an opinion or
 assertion, because an apple is not essential to color, and therefore
 color can be understood independently of the apple. Likewise, the
 things which belong to the species of a material thing, such as a
 stone, or a man, or a horse, can be thought of apart from the
 individualizing principles which do not belong to the notion of the
 species. This is what we mean by abstracting the universal from the
 particular, or the intelligible species from the phantasm; that is,
 by considering the nature of the species apart from its individual
 qualities represented by the phantasms. If, therefore, the intellect
 is said to be false when it understands a thing otherwise than as it
 is, that is so, if the word ""otherwise"" refers to the thing
 understood; for the intellect is false when it understands a thing
 otherwise than as it is; and so the intellect would be false if it
 abstracted the species of a stone from its matter in such a way as to
 regard the species as not existing in matter, as Plato held. But it
 is not so, if the word ""otherwise"" be taken as referring to the one
 who understands. For it is quite true that the mode of understanding,
 in one who understands, is not the same as the mode of a thing in
 existing: since the thing understood is immaterially in the one who
 understands, according to the mode of the intellect, and not
 materially, according to the mode of a material thing.
"," Some have thought that the species of a natural thing
 is a form only, and that matter is not part of the species. If that
 were so, matter would not enter into the definition of natural
 things. Therefore it must be said otherwise, that matter is twofold,
 common, and ""signate"" or individual; common, such as flesh and bone;
 and individual, as this flesh and these bones. The intellect
 therefore abstracts the species of a natural thing from the
 individual sensible matter, but not from the common sensible matter;
 for example, it abstracts the species of man from ""this flesh and
 these bones,"" which do not belong to the species as such, but to the
 individual (Metaph. vii, Did. vi, 10), and need not be considered in
 the species: whereas the species of man cannot be abstracted by the
 intellect from ""flesh and bones.""
"," Colors, as being in individual corporeal matter, have
 the same mode of existence as the power of sight: therefore they can
 impress their own image on the eye. But phantasms, since they are
 images of individuals, and exist in corporeal organs, have not the
 same mode of existence as the human intellect, and therefore have
 not the power of themselves to make an impression on the passive
 intellect. This is done by the power of the active intellect which
 by turning towards the phantasm produces in the passive intellect a
 certain likeness which represents, as to its specific conditions
 only, the thing reflected in the phantasm. It is thus that the
 intelligible species is said to be abstracted from the phantasm;
 not that the identical form which previously was in the phantasm is
 subsequently in the passive intellect, as a body transferred from
 one place to another.
"," Not only does the active intellect throw light on
 the phantasm: it does more; by its own power it abstracts the
 intelligible species from the phantasm. It throws light on the
 phantasm, because, just as the sensitive part acquires a greater
 power by its conjunction with the intellectual part, so by the power
 of the active intellect the phantasms are made more fit for the
 abstraction therefrom of intelligible intentions. Furthermore, the
 active intellect abstracts the intelligible species from the
 phantasm, forasmuch as by the power of the active intellect we are
 able to disregard the conditions of individuality, and to take into
 our consideration the specific nature, the image of which informs
 the passive intellect.
"," Our intellect both abstracts the intelligible species
 from the phantasms, inasmuch as it considers the natures of things
 in universal, and, nevertheless, understands these natures in the
 phantasms since it cannot understand even the things of which it
 abstracts the species, without turning to the phantasms, as we have
 said above (Q. 84, A. 7).
",,,,,,,,,,,
422,"[I, Q. 85, Art. 2]
","Whether the Intelligible Species Abstracted from the Phantasm Is
"," It would seem that the intelligible species abstracted
 from the phantasm is related to our intellect as that which is
 understood. For the understood in act is in the one who understands:
 since the understood in act is the intellect itself in act. But
 nothing of what is understood is in the intellect actually
 understanding, save the abstracted intelligible species. Therefore
 this species is what is actually understood.
"," Further, what is actually understood must be in something;
 else it would be nothing. But it is not in something outside the
 soul: for, since what is outside the soul is material, nothing
 therein can be actually understood. Therefore what is actually
 understood is in the intellect. Consequently it can be nothing else
 than the aforesaid intelligible species.
"," Further, the Philosopher says (1 Peri Herm. i) that ""words
 are signs of the passions in the soul."" But words signify the things
 understood, for we express by word what we understand. Therefore
 these passions of the soul--viz. the intelligible species, are what
 is actually understood.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The thing understood is in the intellect by its own
 likeness; and it is in this sense that we say that the thing actually
 understood is the intellect in act, because the likeness of the thing
 understood is the form of the intellect, as the likeness of a
 sensible thing is the form of the sense in act. Hence it does not
 follow that the intelligible species abstracted is what is actually
 understood; but rather that it is the likeness thereof.
"," In these words ""the thing actually understood"" there
 is a double implication--the thing which is understood, and the fact
 that it is understood. In like manner the words ""abstract universal""
 imply two things, the nature of a thing and its abstraction or
 universality. Therefore the nature itself to which it occurs to be
 understood, abstracted or considered as universal is only in
 individuals; but that it is understood, abstracted or considered as
 universal is in the intellect. We see something similar to this is in
 the senses. For the sight sees the color of the apple apart from its
 smell. If therefore it be asked where is the color which is seen
 apart from the smell, it is quite clear that the color which is seen
 is only in the apple: but that it be perceived apart from the smell,
 this is owing to the sight, forasmuch as the faculty of sight
 receives the likeness of color and not of smell. In like manner
 humanity understood is only in this or that man; but that humanity be
 apprehended without conditions of individuality, that is, that it be
 abstracted and consequently considered as universal, occurs to
 humanity inasmuch as it is brought under the consideration of the
 intellect, in which there is a likeness of the specific nature, but
 not of the principles of individuality.
"," There are two operations in the sensitive part. One, in
 regard of impression only, and thus the operation of the senses takes
 place by the senses being impressed by the sensible. The other is
 formation, inasmuch as the imagination forms for itself an image of
 an absent thing, or even of something never seen. Both of these
 operations are found in the intellect. For in the first place there
 is the passion of the passive intellect as informed by the
 intelligible species; and then the passive intellect thus informed
 forms a definition, or a division, or a composition, expressed by a
 word. Wherefore the concept conveyed by a word is its definition; and
 a proposition conveys the intellect's division or composition. Words
 do not therefore signify the intelligible species themselves; but
 that which the intellect forms for itself for the purpose of judging
 of external things.

423,"[I, Q. 85, Art. 3]
","Whether the More Universal Is First in Our Intellectual Cognition?
"," It would seem that the more universal is not first in
 our intellectual cognition. For what is first and more known in its
 own nature, is secondarily and less known in relation to ourselves.
 But universals come first as regards their nature, because ""that is
 first which does not involve the existence of its correlative""
 (Categor. ix). Therefore the universals are secondarily known as
 regards our intellect.
"," Further, the composition precedes the simple in relation to
 us. But universals are the more simple. Therefore they are known
 secondarily by us.
"," Further, the Philosopher says (Phys. i, 1), that the object
 defined comes in our knowledge before the parts of its definition.
 But the more universal is part of the definition of the less
 universal, as ""animal"" is part of the definition of ""man."" Therefore
 the universals are secondarily known by us.
"," Further, we know causes and principles by their effects. But
 universals are principles. Therefore universals are secondarily known
 by us.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," The universal can be considered in two ways. First,
 the universal nature may be considered together with the intention
 of universality. And since the intention of universality--viz. the
 relation of one and the same to many--is due to intellectual
 abstraction, the universal thus considered is a secondary
 consideration. Hence it is said (De Anima i, 1) that the ""universal
 animal is either nothing or something secondary."" But according to
 Plato, who held that universals are subsistent, the universal
 considered thus would be prior to the particular, for the latter,
 according to him, are mere participations of the subsistent
 universals which he called ideas.
"," The more common universal may be compared to the less
 common, as the whole, and as the part. As the whole, considering that
 in the more universal is potentially contained not only the less
 universal, but also other things, as in ""animal"" is contained not
 only ""man"" but also ""horse."" As part, considering that the less
 common contains in its idea not only the more common, but also more;
 as ""man"" contains not only ""animal"" but also ""rational."" Therefore
 ""animal"" in itself comes into our knowledge before ""man""; but ""man""
 comes before ""animal"" considered as part of the same idea.
"," A part can be known in two ways. First, absolutely
 considered in itself; and thus nothing prevents the parts being known
 before the whole, as stones are known before a house is known.
 Secondly as belonging to a certain whole; and thus we must needs know
 the whole before its parts. For we know a house vaguely before we
 know its different parts. So likewise principles of definition are
 known before the thing defined is known; otherwise the thing defined
 would not be known at all. But as parts of the definition they are
 known after. For we know man vaguely as man before we know how to
 distinguish all that belongs to human nature.
"," The universal, as understood with the intention of
 universality, is, indeed, in a way, a principle of knowledge, in so
 far as the intention of universality results from the mode of
 understanding by way of abstraction. But what is a principle of
 knowledge is not of necessity a principle of existence, as Plato
 thought: since at times we know a cause through its effect, and
 substance through accidents. Wherefore the universal thus considered,
 according to the opinion of Aristotle, is neither a principle of
 existence, nor a substance, as he makes clear (Metaph. vii, Did. vi,
 13). But if we consider the generic or specific nature itself as
 existing in the singular, thus in a way it is in the nature of a
 formal principle in regard to the singulars: for the singular is the
 result of matter, while the idea of species is from the form. But the
 generic nature is compared to the specific nature rather after the
 fashion of a material principle, because the generic nature is taken
 from that which is material in a thing, while the idea of species is
 taken from that which is formal: thus the notion of animal is taken
 from the sensitive part, whereas the notion of man is taken from the
 intellectual part. Thus it is that the ultimate intention of nature
 is to the species and not to the individual, or the genus: because
 the form is the end of generation, while matter is for the sake of
 the form. Neither is it necessary that, as regards us, knowledge of
 any cause or principle should be secondary: since at times through
 sensible causes we become acquainted with unknown effects, and
 sometimes conversely.

","Whether We Can Understand Many Things at the Same Time?
"," It would seem that we can understand many things at the
 same time. For intellect is above time, whereas the succession of
 before and after belongs to time. Therefore the intellect does not
 understand different things in succession, but at the same time.
"," Further, there is nothing to prevent different forms not
 opposed to each other from actually being in the same subject, as,
 for instance, color and smell are in the apple. But intelligible
 species are not opposed to each other. Therefore there is nothing to
 prevent the same intellect being in act as regards different
 intelligible species, and thus it can understand many things at the
 same time.
"," Further, the intellect understands a whole at the same time,
 such as a man or a house. But a whole contains many parts. Therefore
 the intellect understands many things at the same time.
"," Further, we cannot know the difference between two things
 unless we know both at the same time (De Anima iii, 2), and the same
 is to be said of any other comparison. But our intellect knows the
 difference and comparison between one thing and another. Therefore
 it knows many things at the same time.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," The intellect is above that time, which is the measure
 of the movement of corporeal things. But the multitude itself of
 intelligible species causes a certain vicissitude of intelligible
 operations, according as one operation succeeds another. And this
 vicissitude is called time by Augustine, who says (Gen. ad lit. viii,
 20, 22), that ""God moves the spiritual creature through time.""

","Whether Our Intellect Understands by Composition and Division?
"," It would seem that our intellect does not understand by
 composition and division. For composition and division are only of
 many; whereas the intellect cannot understand many things at the same
 time. Therefore it cannot understand by composition and division.
"," Further, every composition and division implies past,
 present, or future time. But the intellect abstracts from time, as
 also from other individual conditions. Therefore the intellect does
 not understand by composition and division.
"," Further, the intellect understands things by a process of
 assimilation to them. But composition and division are not in things,
 for nothing is in things but what is signified by the predicate and
 the subject, and which is one and the same, provided that the
 composition be true, for ""man"" is truly what ""animal"" is. Therefore
 the intellect does not act by composition and division.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Composition and division of the intellect are made by
 differentiating and comparing. Hence the intellect knows many things
 by composition and division, as by knowing the difference and
 comparison of things.
"," Although the intellect abstracts from the phantasms, it
 does not understand actually without turning to the phantasms, as we
 have said (A. 1; Q. 84, A. 7). And forasmuch as it turns to the
 phantasms, composition and division of the intellect involve time.
"," The likeness of a thing is received into the intellect
 according to the mode of the intellect, not according to the mode of
 the thing. Wherefore something on the part of the thing corresponds
 to the composition and division of the intellect; but it does not
 exist in the same way in the intellect and in the thing. For the
 proper object of the human intellect is the quiddity of a material
 thing, which comes under the action of the senses and the
 imagination. Now in a material thing there is a twofold composition.
 First, there is the composition of form with matter; and to this
 corresponds that composition of the intellect whereby the universal
 whole is predicated of its part: for the genus is derived from common
 matter, while the difference that completes the species is derived
 from the form, and the particular from individual matter. The second
 comparison is of accident with subject: and to this real composition
 corresponds that composition of the intellect, whereby accident is
 predicated of subject, as when we say ""the man is white.""
 Nevertheless composition of the intellect differs from composition of
 things; for in the latter the things are diverse, whereas composition
 of the intellect is a sign of the identity of the components. For the
 above composition of the intellect does not imply that ""man"" and
 ""whiteness"" are identical, but the assertion, ""the man is white,""
 means that ""the man is something having whiteness"": and the subject,
 which is a man, is identified with a subject having whiteness. It is
 the same with the composition of form and matter: for animal
 signifies that which has a sensitive nature; rational, that which has
 an intellectual nature; man, that which has both; and Socrates that
 which has all these things together with individual matter; and
 according to this kind of identity our intellect predicates the
 composition of one thing with another.

","Whether the Intellect Can Be False?
"," It would seem that the intellect can be false; for the
 Philosopher says (Metaph. vi, Did. v, 4) that ""truth and falsehood
 are in the mind."" But the mind and intellect are the same, as is
 shown above (Q. 79, A. 1). Therefore falsehood may be in the mind.
"," Further, opinion and reasoning belong to the intellect. But
 falsehood exists in both. Therefore falsehood can be in the intellect.
"," Further, sin is in the intellectual faculty. But sin involves
 falsehood: for ""those err that work evil"" (Prov. 14:22). Therefore
 falsehood can be in the intellect.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The Philosopher says that falsehood is in the intellect
 in regard to composition and division. The same answer applies to the
 Second Objection concerning opinion and reasoning, and to the Third
 Objection, concerning the error of the sinner, who errs in the
 practical judgment of the appetible object. But in the absolute
 consideration of the quiddity of a thing, and of those things which
 are known thereby, the intellect is never deceived. In this sense are
 to be understood the authorities quoted in proof of the opposite
 conclusion.

","Whether One Person Can Understand One and the Same Thing Better Than

 the same thing better than another can. For Augustine says (QQ. 83,
 qu. 32), ""Whoever understands a thing otherwise than as it is, does
 not understand it at all. Hence it is clear that there is a perfect
 understanding, than which none other is more perfect: and therefore
 there are not infinite degrees of understanding a thing: nor can one
 person understand a thing better than another can.""
"," Further, the intellect is true in its act of understanding.
 But truth, being a certain equality between thought and thing, is not
 subject to more or less; for a thing cannot be said to be more or
 less equal. Therefore a thing cannot be more or less understood.
"," Further, the intellect is the most formal of all that is in
 man. But different forms cause different species. Therefore if one
 man understands better than another, it would seem that they do not
 belong to the same species.

 different disposition of matter, causes not a specific but only a

","Whether the Intellect Understands the Indivisible Before the
"," It would seem that the intellect understands the
 indivisible before the divisible. For the Philosopher says (Phys. i,
 1) that ""we understand and know from the knowledge of principles and
 elements."" But principles are indivisible, and elements are of
 divisible things. Therefore the indivisible is known to us before the
 divisible.
"," Further, the definition of a thing contains what is known
 previously, for a definition ""proceeds from the first and more
 known,"" as is said Topic. vi, 4. But the indivisible is part of the
 definition of the divisible; as a point comes into the definition of
 a line; for as Euclid says, ""a line is length without breadth, the
 extremities of which are points""; also unity comes into the
 definition of number, for ""number is multitude measured by one,"" as
 is said Metaph. x, Did. ix, 6. Therefore our intellect understands
 the indivisible before the divisible.
"," Further, ""Like is known by like."" But the indivisible is more
 like to the intellect than is the divisible; because ""the intellect
 is simple"" (De Anima iii, 4). Therefore our intellect first knows the
 indivisible.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," In the acquisition of knowledge, principles and
 elements are not always (known) first: for sometimes from sensible
 effects we arrive at the knowledge of principles and intelligible
 causes. But in perfect knowledge, the knowledge of effects always
 depends on the knowledge of principles and elements: for as the
 Philosopher says in the same passage: ""Then do we consider that we
 know, when we can resolve principles into their causes.""
"," A point is not included in the definition of a line in
 general: for it is manifest that in a line of indefinite length, and
 in a circular line, there is no point, save potentially. Euclid
 defines a finite straight line: and therefore he mentions a point in
 the definition, as the limit in the definition of that which is
 limited. Unity is the measure of number: wherefore it is included in
 the definition of a measured number. But it is not included in the
 definition of the divisible, but rather conversely.
"," The likeness through which we understand is the species
 of the known in the knower; therefore a thing is known first, not on
 account of its natural likeness to the cognitive power, but on
 account of the power's aptitude for the object: otherwise sight would
 perceive hearing rather than color.

","Whether Our Intellect Knows Singulars?
"," It would seem that our intellect knows singulars. For
 whoever knows composition, knows the terms of composition. But our
 intellect knows this composition; ""Socrates is a man"": for it belongs
 to the intellect to form a proposition. Therefore our intellect knows
 this singular, Socrates.
"," Further, the practical intellect directs to action. But
 action has relation to singular things. Therefore the intellect knows
 the singular.
"," Further, our intellect understands itself. But in itself it
 is a singular, otherwise it would have no action of its own; for
 actions belong to singulars. Therefore our intellect knows singulars.
"," Further, a superior power can do whatever is done by an
 inferior power. But sense knows the singular. Much more, therefore,
 can the intellect know it.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," The choice of a particular thing to be done is as the
 conclusion of a syllogism formed by the practical intellect, as is
 said Ethic. vii, 3. But a singular proposition cannot be directly
 concluded from a universal proposition, except through the medium of
 a singular proposition. Therefore the universal principle of the
 practical intellect does not move save through the medium of the
 particular apprehension of the sensitive part, as is said De Anima
 iii, 11.
"," Intelligibility is incompatible with the singular not
 as such, but as material, for nothing can be understood otherwise
 than immaterially. Therefore if there be an immaterial singular such
 as the intellect, there is no reason why it should not be
 intelligible.
"," The higher power can do what the lower power can, but
 in a more eminent way. Wherefore what the sense knows materially and
 concretely, which is to know the singular directly, the intellect
 knows immaterially and in the abstract, which is to know the
 universal.

","Whether Our Intellect Can Know the Infinite?
"," It would seem that our intellect can know the infinite.
 For God excels all infinite things. But our intellect can know God,
 as we have said above (Q. 12, A. 1). Much more, therefore, can our
 intellect know all other infinite things.
"," Further, our intellect can naturally know genera and
 species. But there is an infinity of species in some genera, as in
 number, proportion, and figure. Therefore our intellect can know
 the infinite.
"," Further, if one body can coexist with another in the same
 place, there is nothing to prevent an infinite number of bodies being
 in one place. But one intelligible species can exist with another in
 the same intellect, for many things can be habitually known at the
 same time. Therefore our intellect can have an habitual knowledge of
 an infinite number of things.
"," Further, as the intellect is not a corporeal faculty, as we
 have said (Q. 76, A. 1), it appears to be an infinite power. But an
 infinite power has a capacity for an infinite object. Therefore our
 intellect can know the infinite.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," As we have said above (Q. 7, A. 1), God is called
 infinite, because He is a form unlimited by matter; whereas in
 material things, the term ""infinite"" is applied to that which is
 deprived of any formal term. And form being known in itself, whereas
 matter cannot be known without form, it follows that the material
 infinite is in itself unknowable. But the formal infinite, God, is
 of Himself known; but He is unknown to us by reason of our feeble
 intellect, which in its present state has a natural aptitude for
 material objects only. Therefore we cannot know God in our present
 life except through material effects. In the future life this defect
 of intellect will be removed by the state of glory, when we shall be
 able to see the Essence of God Himself, but without being able to
 comprehend Him.
"," The nature of our mind is to know species abstracted
 from phantasms; therefore it cannot know actually or habitually
 species of numbers or figures that are not in the imagination, except
 in a general way and in their universal principles; and this is to
 know them potentially and confusedly.
"," If two or more bodies were in the same place, there
 would be no need for them to occupy the place successively, in order
 for the things placed to be counted according to this succession of
 occupation. On the other hand, the intelligible species enter into
 our intellect successively; since many things cannot be actually
 understood at the same time: and therefore there must be a definite
 and not an infinite number of species in our intellect.
"," As our intellect is infinite in power, so does it know
 the infinite. For its power is indeed infinite inasmuch as it is not
 terminated by corporeal matter. Moreover it can know the universal,
 which is abstracted from individual matter, and which consequently is
 not limited to one individual, but, considered in itself, extends to
 an infinite number of individuals.

 of understanding, wisdom and knowledge are not contingent, but
 necessary things.
"," Further, as stated in Phys. iv, 12, ""what sometimes is and
 sometimes is not, is measured by time."" Now the intellect abstracts
 from time, and from other material conditions. Therefore, as it is
 proper to a contingent thing sometime to be and sometime not to be,
 it seems that contingent things are not known by the intellect.

","Whether Our Intellect Can Know the Future?
"," It would seem that our intellect knows the future. For
 our intellect knows by means of intelligible species abstracted from
 the ""here"" and ""now,"" and related indifferently to all time. But it
 can know the present. Therefore it can know the future.
"," Further, man, while his senses are in suspense, can know
 some future things, as in sleep, and in frenzy. But the intellect
 is freer and more vigorous when removed from sense. Therefore the
 intellect of its own nature can know the future.
"," The intellectual knowledge of man is superior to any
 knowledge of brutes. But some animals know the future; thus crows
 by their frequent cawing foretell rain. Therefore much more can
 the intellect know the future.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," This argument considers that knowledge which is drawn
 from universal causal principles; from these the future may be known,
 according to the order of the effects to the cause.
"," As Augustine says (Confess. xii [*Gen. ad lit. xii.
 13]), the soul has a certain power of forecasting, so that by its very
 nature it can know the future; hence when withdrawn from corporeal
 sense, and, as it were, concentrated on itself, it shares in the
 knowledge of the future. Such an opinion would be reasonable if we
 were to admit that the soul receives knowledge by participating the
 ideas as the Platonists maintained, because in that case the soul by
 its nature would know the universal causes of all effects, and would
 only be impeded in its knowledge by the body, and hence when
 withdrawn from the corporeal senses it would know the future.
"," Brute animals have no power above the imagination
 wherewith to regulate it, as man has his reason, and therefore their
 imagination follows entirely the influence of the heavenly bodies.
 Thus from such animals' movements some future things, such as rain
 and the like, may be known rather than from human movements directed
 by reason. Hence the Philosopher says (De Somn. et Vig.), that ""some
 who are most imprudent are most far-seeing; for their intelligence
 is not burdened with cares, but is as it were barren and bare of all
 anxiety moving at the caprice of whatever is brought to bear on it.""

","Whether the Intellectual Soul Knows Itself by Its Essence?
"," It would seem that the intellectual soul knows itself by
 its own essence. For Augustine says (De Trin. ix, 3), that ""the mind
 knows itself, because it is incorporeal.""
"," Further, both angels and human souls belong to the genus of
 intellectual substance. But an angel understands itself by its own
 essence. Therefore likewise does the human soul.
"," Further, ""in things void of matter, the intellect and that
 which is understood are the same"" (De Anima iii, 4). But the human
 mind is void of matter, not being the act of a body as stated above
 (Q. 76, A. 1). Therefore the intellect and its object are the same in
 the human mind; and therefore the human mind understands itself by
 its own essence.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The mind knows itself by means of itself, because at
 length it acquires knowledge of itself, though led thereto by its own
 act: because it is itself that it knows, since it loves itself, as he
 says in the same passage. For a thing can be called self-evident in
 two ways, either because we can know it by nothing else except
 itself, as first principles are called self-evident; or because it is
 not accidentally knowable, as color is visible of itself, whereas
 substance is visible by its accident.
"," The essence of an angel is an act in the genus of
 intelligible things, and therefore it is both intellect and the thing
 understood. Hence an angel apprehends his own essence through itself:
 not so the human mind, which is either altogether in potentiality to
 intelligible things--as is the passive intellect--or is the act of
 intelligible things abstracted from the phantasms--as is the active
 intellect.
"," This saying of the Philosopher is universally true in
 every kind of intellect. For as sense in act is the sensible in act,
 by reason of the sensible likeness which is the form of sense in act,
 so likewise the intellect in act is the object understood in act, by
 reason of the likeness of the thing understood, which is the form of
 the intellect in act. So the human intellect, which becomes actual by
 the species of the object understood, is itself understood by the
 same species as by its own form. Now to say that in ""things without
 matter the intellect and what is understood are the same,"" is equal
 to saying that ""as regards things actually understood the intellect
 and what is understood are the same."" For a thing is actually
 understood in that it is immaterial. But a distinction must be drawn:
 since the essences of some things are immaterial--as the separate
 substances called angels, each of which is understood and
 understands, whereas there are other things whose essences are not
 wholly immaterial, but only the abstract likenesses thereof. Hence
 the Commentator says (De Anima iii) that the proposition quoted is
 true only of separate substances; because in a sense it is verified
 in their regard, and not in regard of other substances, as already
 stated (Reply Obj. 2).

","Whether Our Intellect Knows the Habits of the Soul by Their Essence?
"," It would seem that our intellect knows the habits of the
 soul by their essence. For Augustine says (De Trin. xiii, 1): ""Faith
 is not seen in the heart wherein it abides, as the soul of a man may
 be seen by another from the movement of the body; but we know most
 certainly that it is there, and conscience proclaims its existence"";
 and the same principle applies to the other habits of the soul.
 Therefore the habits of the soul are not known by their acts, but by
 themselves.
"," Further, material things outside the soul are known by their
 likeness being present in the soul, and are said therefore to be
 known by their likenesses. But the soul's habits are present by their
 essence in the soul. Therefore the habits of the soul are known by
 their essence.
"," Further, ""whatever is the cause of a thing being such is
 still more so."" But habits and intelligible species cause things to
 be known by the soul. Therefore they are still more known by the soul
 in themselves.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Although faith is not known by external movement of
 the body, it is perceived by the subject wherein it resides, by the
 interior act of the heart. For no one knows that he has faith unless
 he knows that he believes.
"," Habits are present in our intellect, not as its object
 since, in the present state of life, our intellect's object is the
 nature of a material thing as stated above (Q. 84, A. 7), but as that
 by which it understands.
"," The axiom, ""whatever is the cause of a thing being
 such, is still more so,"" is true of things that are of the same
 order, for instance, of the same kind of cause; for example, we may
 say that health is desirable on account of life, and therefore life
 is more desirable still. But if we take things of different orders
 the axiom is not true: for we may say that health is caused by
 medicine, but it does not follow that medicine is more desirable than
 health, for health belongs to the order of final causes, whereas
 medicine belongs to the order of efficient causes. So of two things
 belonging essentially to the order of the objects of knowledge, the
 one which is the cause of the other being known, is the more known,
 as principles are more known than conclusions. But habit as such does
 not belong to the order of objects of knowledge; nor are things known
 on account of the habit, as on account of an object known, but as on
 account of a disposition or form whereby the subject knows: and
 therefore the argument does not prove.

435,"[I, Q. 87, Art. 3]
","Whether Our Intellect Knows Its Own Act?
"," It would seem that our intellect does not know its own
 act. For what is known is the object of the knowing faculty. But the
 act differs from the object. Therefore the intellect does not know
 its own act.
"," Further, whatever is known is known by some act. If, then,
 the intellect knows its own act, it knows it by some act, and again
 it knows that act by some other act; this is to proceed indefinitely,
 which seems impossible.
"," Further, the intellect has the same relation to its act as
 sense has to its act. But the proper sense does not feel its own act,
 for this belongs to the common sense, as stated De Anima iii, 2.
 Therefore neither does the intellect understand its own act.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The object of the intellect is something universal,
 namely, being and the true, in which the act also of
 understanding is comprised. Wherefore the intellect can understand
 its own act. But not primarily, since the first object of our
 intellect, in this state of life, is not every being and everything
 true, but being and true, as considered in material things, as
 we have said above (Q. 84, A. 7), from which it acquires knowledge
 of all other things.
"," The intelligent act of the human intellect is not the
 act and perfection of the material nature understood, as if the
 nature of the material thing and intelligent act could be understood
 by one act; just as a thing and its perfection are understood by one
 act. Hence the act whereby the intellect understands a stone is
 distinct from the act whereby it understands that it understands a
 stone; and so on. Nor is there any difficulty in the intellect being
 thus potentially infinite, as explained above (Q. 86, A. 2).
"," The proper sense feels by reason of the immutation in
 the material organ caused by the external sensible. A material
 object, however, cannot immute itself; but one is immuted by another,
 and therefore the act of the proper sense is perceived by the common
 sense. The intellect, on the contrary, does not perform the act of
 understanding by the material immutation of an organ; and so there
 is no comparison.

","Whether the Intellect Understands the Act of the Will?
"," It would seem that the intellect does not understand the
 act of the will. For nothing is known by the intellect, unless it be
 in some way present in the intellect. But the act of the will is not
 in the intellect; since the will and the intellect are distinct.
 Therefore the act of the will is not known by the intellect.
"," Further, the act is specified by the object. But the object
 of the will is not the same as the object of the intellect. Therefore
 the act of the will is specifically distinct from the object of the
 intellect, and therefore the act of the will is not known by the
 intellect.
"," Augustine (Confess. x, 17) says of the soul's affections that
 ""they are known neither by images as bodies are known; nor by their
 presence, like the arts; but by certain notions."" Now it does not
 seem that there can be in the soul any other notions of things but
 either the essences of things known or the likenesses thereof.
 Therefore it seems impossible for the intellect to known such
 affections of the soul as the acts of the will.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," This argument would hold good if the will and the
 intellect were in different subjects, as they are distinct powers;
 for then whatever was in the will would not be in the intellect. But
 as both are rooted in the same substance of the soul, and since one
 is in a certain way the principle of the other, consequently what is
 in the will is, in a certain way, also in the intellect.
"," The ""good"" and the ""true"" which are the objects of the
 will and of the intellect, differ logically, but one is contained in
 the other, as we have said above (Q. 82, A. 4, ad 1; Q. 16, A. 4, ad
 1); for the true is good and the good is true. Therefore the objects
 of the will fall under the intellect, and those of the intellect can
 fall under the will.
"," The affections of the soul are in the intellect not by
 similitude only, like bodies; nor by being present in their subject,
 as the arts; but as the thing caused is in its principle, which
 contains some notion of the thing caused. And so Augustine says that
 the soul's affections are in the memory by certain notions.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
437,"[I, Q. 88, Art. 1]
","Whether the Human Soul in the Present State of Life Can Understand
"," It would seem that the human soul in the present state of
 life can understand immaterial substances in themselves. For Augustine
 (De Trin. ix, 3) says: ""As the mind itself acquires the knowledge of
 corporeal things by means of the corporeal senses, so it gains from
 itself the knowledge of incorporeal things."" But these are the
 immaterial substances. Therefore the human mind understands immaterial
 substances.
"," Further, like is known by like. But the human mind is more
 akin to immaterial than to material things; since its own nature is
 immaterial, as is clear from what we have said above (Q. 76, A. 1).
 Since then our mind understands material things, much more is it able
 to understand immaterial things.
"," Further, the fact that objects which are in themselves most
 sensible are not most felt by us, comes from sense being corrupted by
 their very excellence. But the intellect is not subject to such a
 corrupting influence from its object, as is stated De Anima iii, 4.
 Therefore things which are in themselves in the highest degree of
 intelligibility, are likewise to us most intelligible. As material
 things, however, are intelligible only so far as we make them
 actually so by abstracting them from material conditions, it is clear
 that those substances are more intelligible in themselves whose
 nature is immaterial. Therefore they are much more known to us than
 are material things.
"," Further, the Commentator says (Metaph. ii) that ""nature would
 be frustrated in its end"" were we unable to understand abstract
 substances, ""because it would have made what in itself is naturally
 intelligible not to be understood at all."" But in nature nothing is
 idle or purposeless. Therefore immaterial substances can be
 understood by us.
"," Further, as sense is to the sensible, so is intellect to the
 intelligible. But our sight can see all things corporeal, whether
 superior and incorruptible; or lower and corruptible. Therefore our
 intellect can understand all intelligible substances, even the
 superior and immaterial.
",,,,,,,,,,,,," Augustine may be taken to mean that the knowledge of
 incorporeal things in the mind can be gained by the mind itself. This
 is so true that philosophers also say that the knowledge concerning
 the soul is a principle for the knowledge of separate substances. For
 by knowing itself, it attains to some knowledge of incorporeal
 substances, such as is within its compass; not that the knowledge of
 itself gives it a perfect and absolute knowledge of them.
"," The likeness of nature is not a sufficient cause of
 knowledge; otherwise what Empedocles said would be true--that the
 soul needs to have the nature of all in order to know all. But
 knowledge requires that the likeness of the thing known be in the
 knower, as a kind of form thereof. Now our passive intellect, in
 the present state of life, is such that it can be informed with
 similitudes abstracted from phantasms: and therefore it knows
 material things rather than immaterial substances.
"," There must needs be some proportion between the object
 and the faculty of knowledge; such as of the active to the passive,
 and of perfection to the perfectible. Hence that sensible objects of
 great power are not grasped by the senses, is due not merely to the
 fact that they corrupt the organ, but also to their being
 improportionate to the sensitive power. And thus it is that
 immaterial substances are improportionate to our intellect, in our
 present state of life, so that it cannot understand them.
"," This argument of the Commentator fails in several ways.
 First, because if separate substances are not understood by us, it
 does not follow that they are not understood by any intellect; for
 they are understood by themselves, and by one another.
"," Sense knows bodies, whether superior or inferior, in
 the same way, that is, by the sensible acting on the organ. But we do
 not understand material and immaterial substances in the same way.
 The former we understand by a process of abstraction, which is
 impossible in the case of the latter, for there are no phantasms of
 what is immaterial.
",,,,,,,,,,,
438,"[I, Q. 88, Art. 2]
","Whether Our Intellect Can Understand Immaterial Substances Through Its
"," It would seem that our intellect can know immaterial
 substances through the knowledge of material things. For Dionysius
 says (Coel. Hier. i) that ""the human mind cannot be raised up to
 immaterial contemplation of the heavenly hierarchies, unless it is
 led thereto by material guidance according to its own nature.""
 Therefore we can be led by material things to know immaterial
 substances.
"," Further, science resides in the intellect. But there are
 sciences and definitions of immaterial substances; for Damascene
 defines an angel (De Fide Orth. ii, 3); and we find angels treated of
 both in theology and philosophy. Therefore immaterial substances can
 be understood by us.
"," Further, the human soul belongs to the genus of immaterial
 substances. But it can be understood by us through its act by which
 it understands material things. Therefore also other material
 substances can be understood by us, through their material effects.
"," Further, the only cause which cannot be comprehended through
 its effects is that which is infinitely distant from them, and this
 belongs to God alone. Therefore other created immaterial substances
 can be understood by us through material things.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," From material things we can rise to some kind of
 knowledge of immaterial things, but not to the perfect knowledge
 thereof; for there is no proper and adequate proportion between
 material and immaterial things, and the likenesses drawn from
 material things for the understanding of immaterial things are
 very dissimilar therefrom, as Dionysius says (Coel. Hier. ii).
"," Science treats of higher things principally by way of
 negation. Thus Aristotle (De Coel. i, 3) explains the heavenly bodies
 by denying to them inferior corporeal properties. Hence it follows
 that much less can immaterial substances be known by us in such a way
 as to make us know their quiddity; but we may have a scientific
 knowledge of them by way of negation and by their relation to
 material things.
"," The human soul understands itself through its own act
 of understanding, which is proper to it, showing perfectly its power
 and nature. But the power and nature of immaterial substances cannot
 be perfectly known through such act, nor through any other material
 thing, because there is no proportion between the latter and the
 power of the former.
"," Created immaterial substances are not in the same
 natural genus as material substances, for they do not agree in power
 or in matter; but they belong to the same logical genus, because even
 immaterial substances are in the predicament of substance, as their
 essence is distinct from their existence. But God has no connection
 with material things, as regards either natural genus or logical
 genus; because God is in no genus, as stated above (Q. 3, A. 5).
 Hence through the likeness derived from material things we can know
 something positive concerning the angels, according to some common
 notion, though not according to the specific nature; whereas we
 cannot acquire any such knowledge at all about God.

","Whether God Is the First Object Known by the Human Mind?
"," It would seem that God is the first object known by the
 human mind. For that object in which all others are known, and by
 which we judge others, is the first thing known to us; as light is to
 the eye, and first principles to the intellect. But we know all things
 in the light of the first truth, and thereby judge of all things, as
 Augustine says (De Trin. xii, 2; De Vera Relig. xxxi); [*Confess. xii,
 25]. Therefore God is the first object known to us.
"," Further, whatever causes a thing to be such is more so. But
 God is the cause of all our knowledge; for He is ""the true light
 which enlighteneth every man that cometh into this world"" (John 1:9).
 Therefore God is our first and most known object.
"," Further, what is first known in the image is the exemplar to
 which it is made. But in our mind is the image of God, as Augustine
 says (De Trin. xii, 4,7). Therefore God is the first object known to
 our mind.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," We see and judge of all things in the light of the
 first truth, forasmuch as the light itself of our mind, whether
 natural or gratuitous, is nothing else than the impression of the
 first truth upon it, as stated above (Q. 12, A. 2). Hence, as the
 light itself of our intellect is not the object it understands, much
 less can it be said that God is the first object known by our
 intellect.
"," The axiom, ""Whatever causes a thing to be such is more
 so,"" must be understood of things belonging to one and the same
 order, as explained above (Q. 81, A. 2, ad 3). Other things than God
 are known because of God; not as if He were the first known object,
 but because He is the first cause of our faculty of knowledge.
"," If there existed in our souls a perfect image of God,
 as the Son is the perfect image of the Father, our mind would know
 God at once. But the image in our mind is imperfect; hence the
 argument does not prove.

440,"[I, Q. 89, Art. 1]
","Whether the Separated Soul Can Understand Anything?
"," It would seem that the soul separated from the body can
 understand nothing at all. For the Philosopher says (De Anima i, 4)
 that ""the understanding is corrupted together with its interior
 principle."" But by death all human interior principles are corrupted.
 Therefore also the intellect itself is corrupted.
"," Further, the human soul is hindered from understanding when
 the senses are tied, and by a distracted imagination, as explained
 above (Q. 84, AA. 7,8). But death destroys the senses and
 imagination, as we have shown above (Q. 77, A. 8). Therefore after
 death the soul understands nothing.
"," Further, if the separated soul can understand, this must be
 by means of some species. But it does not understand by means of
 innate species, because it has none such; being at first ""like a
 tablet on which nothing is written"": nor does it understand by
 species abstracted from things, for it does not then possess organs
 of sense and imagination which are necessary for the abstraction of
 species: nor does it understand by means of species, formerly
 abstracted and retained in the soul; for if that were so, a child's
 soul would have no means of understanding at all: nor does it
 understand by means of intelligible species divinely infused, for
 such knowledge would not be natural, such as we treat of now, but the
 effect of grace. Therefore the soul apart from the body understands
 nothing.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The Philosopher's words carefully examined will show
 that he said this on the previous supposition that understanding is a
 movement of body and soul as united, just as sensation is, for he had
 not as yet explained the difference between intellect and sense. We
 may also say that he is referring to the way of understanding by
 turning to phantasms. This is also the meaning of the second
 objection.
"," The separated soul does not understand by way of
 innate species, nor by species abstracted then, nor only by species
 retained, and this the objection proves; but the soul in that state
 understands by means of participated species arising from the
 influence of the Divine light, shared by the soul as by other
 separate substances; though in a lesser degree. Hence as soon as it
 ceases to act by turning to corporeal (phantasms), the soul turns at
 once to the superior things; nor is this way of knowledge unnatural,
 for God is the author of the influx of both of the light of grace
 and of the light of nature.

441,"[I, Q. 89, Art. 2]
","Whether the Separated Soul Understands Separate Substances?
"," It would seem that the separated soul does not
 understand separate substances. For the soul is more perfect when
 joined to the body than when existing apart from it, being an
 essential part of human nature; and every part of a whole is more
 perfect when it exists in that whole. But the soul in the body does
 not understand separate substances as shown above (Q. 88, A. 1).
 Therefore much less is it able to do so when apart from the body.
"," Further, whatever is known is known either by its presence or
 by its species. But separate substances cannot be known to the soul
 by their presence, for God alone can enter into the soul; nor by
 means of species abstracted by the soul from an angel, for an angel
 is more simple than a soul. Therefore the separated soul cannot at
 all understand separate substances.
"," Further, some philosophers said that the ultimate happiness
 of man consists in the knowledge of separate substances. If,
 therefore, the separated soul can understand separate substances, its
 happiness would be secured by its separation alone; which cannot be
 reasonably be said.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The separated soul is, indeed, less perfect considering
 its nature in which it communicates with the nature of the body: but
 it has a greater freedom of intelligence, since the weight and care
 of the body is a clog upon the clearness of its intelligence in the
 present life.
"," The separated soul understands the angels by means of
 divinely impressed ideas; which, however, fail to give perfect
 knowledge of them, forasmuch as the nature of the soul is inferior to
 that of an angel.
"," Man's ultimate happiness consists not in the knowledge
 of any separate substances; but in the knowledge of God, Who is seen
 only by grace. The knowledge of other separate substances if
 perfectly understood gives great happiness--not final and ultimate
 happiness. But the separated soul does not understand them perfectly,
 as was shown above in this article.

442,"[I, Q. 89, Art. 3]
","Whether the Separated Soul Knows All Natural Things?
"," It would seem that the separated soul knows all natural
 things. For the types of all natural things exist in separate
 substances. Therefore, as separated souls know separate substances,
 they also know all natural things.
"," Further, whoever understands the greater intelligible, will
 be able much more to understand the lesser intelligible. But the
 separated soul understands immaterial substances, which are in the
 highest degree of intelligibility. Therefore much more can it
 understand all natural things which are in a lower degree of
 intelligibility.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Even an angel does not understand all natural things
 through his substance, but through certain species, as stated above
 (Q. 87, A. 1). So it does not follow that the soul knows all natural
 things because it knows separate substances after a fashion.
"," As the soul separated from the body does not perfectly
 understand separate substances, so neither does it know all natural
 things perfectly; but it knows them confusedly, as above explained in
 this article.
"," Isidore speaks of the knowledge of the future which
 neither angels, nor demons, nor separated souls, know except so far
 as future things pre-exist in their causes or are known by Divine
 revelation. But we are here treating of the knowledge of natural
 things.
"," Knowledge acquired here by study is proper and perfect;
 the knowledge of which we speak is confused. Hence it does not follow
 that to study in order to learn is useless.

443,"[I, Q. 89, Art. 4]
","Whether the Separated Soul Knows Singulars?
"," It would seem that the separated soul does not know
 singulars. For no cognitive power besides the intellect remains in
 the separated soul, as is clear from what has been said above (Q. 77,
 A. 8). But the intellect cannot know singulars, as we have shown (Q.
 86, A. 1). Therefore the separated soul cannot know singulars.
"," Further, the knowledge of the singular is more determinate
 than knowledge of the universal. But the separated soul has no
 determinate knowledge of the species of natural things, therefore
 much less can it know singulars.
"," Further, if it knew the singulars, yet not by sense, for the
 same reason it would know all singulars. But it does not know all
 singulars. Therefore it knows none.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The intellect does not know the singular by way of
 abstraction; neither does the separated soul know it thus; but as
 explained above.
"," The knowledge of the separated soul is confined to
 those species or individuals to which the soul has some kind of
 determinate relation, as we have said.
"," The separated soul has not the same relation to all
 singulars, but one relation to some, and another to others. Therefore
 there is not the same reason why it should know all singulars.

","Whether the Habit of Knowledge Here Acquired Remains in the Separated
"," It would seem that the habit of knowledge acquired in
 this life does not remain in the soul separated from the body: for
 the Apostle says: ""Knowledge shall be destroyed"" (1 Cor. 13:8).
"," Further, some in this world who are less good enjoy knowledge
 denied to others who are better. If, therefore, the habit of
 knowledge remained in the soul after death, it would follow that some
 who are less good would, even in the future life, excel some who are
 better; which seems unreasonable.
"," Further, separated souls will possess knowledge by influence
 of the Divine light. Supposing, therefore, that knowledge here
 acquired remained in the separated soul, it would follow that two
 forms of the same species would co-exist in the same subject which
 cannot be.
"," Further, the Philosopher says (Praedic. vi, 4, 5), that ""a
 habit is a quality hard to remove: yet sometimes knowledge is
 destroyed by sickness or the like."" But in this life there is no
 change so thorough as death. Therefore it seems that the habit of
 knowledge is destroyed by death.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," The Apostle is not speaking of knowledge as a habit,
 but as to the act of knowing; and hence he says, in proof of the
 assertion quoted, ""Now, I know in part.""
"," As a less good man may exceed a better man in bodily
 stature, so the same kind of man may have a habit of knowledge in the
 future life which a better man may not have. Such knowledge, however,
 cannot be compared with the other prerogatives enjoyed by the better
 man.
"," These two kinds of knowledge are not of the same
 species, so there is no impossibility.
"," This objection considers the corruption of knowledge on
 the part of the sensitive powers.
",,,,,,,,,,,,
445,"[I, Q. 89, Art. 6]
","Whether the Act of Knowledge Acquired Here Remains in the Separated
"," It would seem that the act of knowledge here acquired
 does not remain in the separated soul. For the Philosopher says (De
 Anima i, 4), that when the body is corrupted, ""the soul neither
 remembers nor loves."" But to consider what is previously known is an
 act of memory. Therefore the separated soul cannot retain an act of
 knowledge here acquired.
"," Further, intelligible species cannot have greater power in
 the separated soul than they have in the soul united to the body. But
 in this life we cannot understand by intelligible species without
 turning to phantasms, as shown above (Q. 84, A. 7). Therefore the
 separated soul cannot do so, and thus it cannot understand at all by
 intelligible species acquired in this life.
"," Further, the Philosopher says (Ethic. ii, 1), that ""habits
 produce acts similar to those whereby they are acquired."" But the
 habit of knowledge is acquired here by acts of the intellect turning
 to phantasms: therefore it cannot produce any other acts. These acts,
 however, are not adapted to the separated soul. Therefore the soul in
 the state of separation cannot produce any act of knowledge acquired
 in this life.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The Philosopher speaks of remembrance, according as
 memory belongs to the sensitive part, but not as belonging in a way
 to the intellect, as explained above (Q. 79, A. 6).
"," The different mode of intelligence is produced by the
 different state of the intelligent soul; not by diversity of species.
"," The acts which produce a habit are like the acts caused
 by that habit, in species, but not in mode. For example, to do just
 things, but not justly, that is, pleasurably, causes the habit of
 political justice, whereby we act pleasurably. (Cf. Aristotle, Ethic.
 v, 8: Magn. Moral. i, 34).

446,"[I, Q. 89, Art. 7]
","Whether Local Distance Impedes the Knowledge in the Separated Soul?
"," It would seem that local distance impedes the separated
 soul's knowledge. For Augustine says (De Cura pro Mort. xiii), that
 ""the souls of the dead are where they cannot know what is done here.""
 But they know what is done among themselves. Therefore local distance
 impedes the knowledge in the separated soul.
"," Further, Augustine says (De Divin. Daemon. iii), that ""the
 demons' rapidity of movement enables them to tell things unknown to
 us."" But agility of movement would be useless in that respect unless
 their knowledge was impeded by local distance; which, therefore, is a
 much greater hindrance to the knowledge of the separated soul, whose
 nature is inferior to the demon's.
"," Further, as there is distance of place, so is there distance
 of time. But distance of time impedes knowledge in the separated
 soul, for the soul is ignorant of the future. Therefore it seems that
 distance of place also impedes its knowledge.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Augustine says that the souls of the departed cannot
 see what is done here, not because they are ""there,"" as if impeded by
 local distance; but for some other cause, as we shall explain (A. 8).
"," Augustine speaks there in accordance with the opinion
 that demons have bodies naturally united to them, and so have
 sensitive powers, which require local distance. In the same book he
 expressly sets down this opinion, though apparently rather by way of
 narration than of assertion, as we may gather from De Civ. Dei xxi,
 10.
"," The future, which is distant in time, does not actually
 exist, and therefore is not knowable in itself, because so far as a
 thing falls short of being, so far does it fall short of being
 knowable. But what is locally distant exists actually, and is
 knowable in itself. Hence we cannot argue from distance of time to
 distance of place.

","Whether Separated Souls Know What Takes Place on Earth?
"," It would seem that separated souls know what takes place
 on earth; for otherwise they would have no care for it, as they have,
 according to what Dives said (Luke 16:27, 28), ""I have five brethren
 . . . he may testify unto them, lest they also come into the place of
 torments."" Therefore separated souls know what passes on earth.
"," Further, the dead often appear to the living, asleep or
 awake, and tell them of what takes place there; as Samuel appeared to
 Saul (1 Kings 28:11). But this could not be unless they knew what
 takes place here. Therefore they know what takes place on earth.
"," Further, separated souls know what happens among themselves.
 If, therefore, they do not know what takes place among us, it must be
 by reason of local distance; which has been shown to be false (A. 7).
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The souls of the departed may care for the living, even
 if ignorant of their state; just as we care for the dead by pouring
 forth prayer on their behalf, though we are ignorant of their state.
 Moreover, the affairs of the living can be made known to them not
 immediately, but the souls who pass hence thither, or by angels and
 demons, or even by ""the revelation of the Holy Ghost,"" as Augustine
 says in the same book.
"," That the dead appear to the living in any way whatever
 is either by the special dispensation of God; in order that the souls
 of the dead may interfere in affairs of the living--and this is to be
 accounted as miraculous. Or else such apparitions occur through the
 instrumentality of bad or good angels, without the knowledge of the
 departed; as may likewise happen when the living appear, without
 their own knowledge, to others living, as Augustine says in the same
 book. And so it may be said of Samuel that he appeared through Divine
 revelation; according to Ecclus. 46:23, ""he slept, and told the king
 the end of his life."" Or, again, this apparition was procured by the
 demons; unless, indeed, the authority of Ecclesiasticus be set aside
 through not being received by the Jews as canonical Scripture.

 obstacle of local distance, but from the cause mentioned above.

448,"[I, Q. 90, Art. 1]
","Whether the Soul Was Made or Was of God's Substance?
"," It would seem that the soul was not made, but was God's
 substance. For it is written (Gen. 2:7): ""God formed man of the slime
 of the earth, and breathed into his face the breath of life, and man
 was made a living soul."" But he who breathes sends forth something of
 himself. Therefore the soul, whereby man lives, is of the Divine
 substance.
"," Further, as above explained (Q. 75, A. 5), the soul is a
 simple form. But a form is an act. Therefore the soul is a pure act;
 which applies to God alone. Therefore the soul is of God's substance.
"," Further, things that exist and do [not] differ are the same.
 But God and the mind exist, and in no way differ, for they could only
 be differentiated by certain differences, and thus would be
 composite. Therefore God and the human mind are the same.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The term ""breathe"" is not to be taken in the material
 sense; but as regards the act of God, to breathe (spirare), is the
 same as to make a spirit. Moreover, in the material sense, man by
 breathing does not send forth anything of his own substance, but an
 extraneous thing.
"," Although the soul is a simple form in its essence, yet
 it is not its own existence, but is a being by participation, as
 above explained (Q. 75, A. 5, ad 4). Therefore it is not a pure act
 like God.
"," That which differs, properly speaking, differs in
 something; wherefore we seek for difference where we find also
 resemblance. For this reason things which differ must in some way be
 compound; since they differ in something, and in something resemble
 each other. In this sense, although all that differ are diverse, yet
 all things that are diverse do not differ. For simple things are
 diverse; yet do not differ from one another by differences which
 enter into their composition. For instance, a man and a horse differ
 by the difference of rational and irrational; but we cannot say that
 these again differ by some further difference.

","Whether the Soul Was Produced by Creation?
"," It would seem that the soul was not produced by
 creation. For that which has in itself something material is produced
 from matter. But the soul is in part material, since it is not a pure
 act. Therefore the soul was made of matter; and hence it was not
 created.
"," Further, every actuality of matter is educed from the
 potentiality of that matter; for since matter is in potentiality to
 act, any act pre-exists in matter potentially. But the soul is the
 act of corporeal matter, as is clear from its definition. Therefore
 the soul is educed from the potentiality of matter.
"," Further, the soul is a form. Therefore, if the soul is
 created, all other forms also are created. Thus no forms would come
 into existence by generation; which is not true.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The soul's simple essence is as the material element,
 while its participated existence is its formal element; which
 participated existence necessarily co-exists with the soul's essence,
 because existence naturally follows the form. The same reason holds
 if the soul is supposed to be composed of some spiritual matter, as
 some maintain; because the said matter is not in potentiality to
 another form, as neither is the matter of a celestial body; otherwise
 the soul would be corruptible. Wherefore the soul cannot in any way
 be made of pre-existent matter.
"," The production of act from the potentiality of matter
 is nothing else but something becoming actually that previously was
 in potentiality. But since the rational soul does not depend in its
 existence on corporeal matter, and is subsistent, and exceeds the
 capacity of corporeal matter, as we have seen (Q. 75, A. 2), it is
 not educed from the potentiality of matter.
"," As we have said, there is no comparison between the
 rational soul and other forms.

450,"[I, Q. 90, Art. 3]
","Whether the Rational Soul Is Produced by God Immediately?
"," It would seem that the rational soul is not immediately
 made by God, but by the instrumentality of the angels. For spiritual
 things have more order than corporeal things. But inferior bodies are
 produced by means of the superior, as Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv).
 Therefore also the inferior spirits, who are the rational souls, are
 produced by means of the superior spirits, the angels.
"," Further, the end corresponds to the beginning of things; for
 God is the beginning and end of all. Therefore the issue of things
 from their beginning corresponds to the forwarding of them to their
 end. But ""inferior things are forwarded by the higher,"" as Dionysius
 says (Eccl. Hier. v); therefore also the inferior are produced into
 existence by the higher, and souls by angels.
"," Further, ""perfect is that which can produce its like,"" as is
 stated Metaph. v. But spiritual substances are much more perfect
 than corporeal. Therefore, since bodies produce their like in their
 own species, much more are angels able to produce something
 specifically inferior to themselves; and such is the rational soul.

451,"[I, Q. 90, Art. 4]
","Whether the Human Soul Was Produced Before the Body?
"," It would seem that the human soul was made before the
 body. For the work of creation preceded the work of distinction and
 adornment, as shown above (Q. 66, A. 1; Q. 70, A. 1). But the soul
 was made by creation; whereas the body was made at the end of the
 work of adornment. Therefore the soul of man was made before the body.
"," Further, the rational soul has more in common with the angels
 than with the brute animals. But angels were created before bodies,
 or at least, at the beginning with corporeal matter; whereas the body
 of man was formed on the sixth day, when also the animals were made.
 Therefore the soul of man was created before the body.
"," Further, the end is proportionate to the beginning. But in
 the end the soul outlasts the body. Therefore in the beginning it was
 created before the body.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," If the soul by its nature were a complete species, so
 that it might be created as to itself, this reason would prove that
 the soul was created by itself in the beginning. But as the soul is
 naturally the form of the body, it was necessarily created, not
 separately, but in the body.
"," The same observation applies to the second objection.
 For if the soul had a species of itself it would have something still
 more in common with the angels. But, as the form of the body, it
 belongs to the animal genus, as a formal principle.
"," That the soul remains after the body, is due to a
 defect of the body, namely, death. Which defect was not due when the
 soul was first created.

452,"[I, Q. 91, Art. 1]
","Whether the Body of the First Man Was Made of the Slime of the Earth?
"," It would seem that the body of the first man was not made
 of the slime of the earth. For it is an act of greater power to make
 something out of nothing than out of something; because ""not being"" is
 farther off from actual existence than ""being in potentiality."" But
 since man is the most honorable of God's lower creatures, it was
 fitting that in the production of man's body, the power of God should
 be most clearly shown. Therefore it should not have been made of the
 slime of the earth, but out of nothing.
"," Further, the heavenly bodies are nobler than earthly bodies.
 But the human body has the greatest nobility; since it is perfected
 by the noblest form, which is the rational soul. Therefore it should
 not be made of an earthly body, but of a heavenly body.
"," Further, fire and air are nobler than earth and water, as is
 clear from their subtlety. Therefore, since the human body is most
 noble, it should rather have been made of fire and air than of the
 slime of the earth.
"," Further, the human body is composed of the four elements.
 Therefore it was not made of the slime of the earth, but of the four
 elements.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," The power of the Divine Creator was manifested in man's
 body when its matter was produced by creation. But it was fitting
 that the human body should be made of the four elements, that man
 might have something in common with the inferior bodies, as being
 something between spiritual and corporeal substances.
"," Although the heavenly body is in itself nobler than the
 earthly body, yet for the acts of the rational soul the heavenly body
 is less adapted. For the rational soul receives the knowledge of
 truth in a certain way through the senses, the organs of which cannot
 be formed of a heavenly body which is impassible. Nor is it true that
 something of the fifth essence enters materially into the composition
 of the human body, as some say, who suppose that the soul is united
 to the body by means of light. For, first of all, what they say is
 false--that light is a body. Secondly, it is impossible for something
 to be taken from the fifth essence, or from a heavenly body, and to
 be mingled with the elements, since a heavenly body is impassible;
 wherefore it does not enter into the composition of mixed bodies,
 except as in the effects of its power.
"," If fire and air, whose action is of greater power,
 predominated also in quantity in the human body, they would entirely
 draw the rest into themselves, and there would be no equality in the
 mingling, such as is required in the composition of man, for the
 sense of touch, which is the foundation of the other senses. For the
 organ of any particular sense must not actually have the contraries
 of which that sense has the perception, but only potentially; either
 in such a way that it is entirely void of the whole genus of such
 contraries--thus, for instance, the pupil of the eye is without
 color, so as to be in potentiality as regards all colors; which is
 not possible in the organ of touch, since it is composed of the very
 elements, the qualities of which are perceived by that sense--or so
 that the organ is a medium between two contraries, as much needs be
 the case with regard to touch; for the medium is in potentiality to
 the extremes.
"," In the slime of the earth are earth, and water binding
 the earth together. Of the other elements, Scripture makes no
 mention, because they are less in quantity in the human body, as we
 have said; and because also in the account of the Creation no mention
 is made of fire and air, which are not perceived by senses of
 uncultured men such as those to whom the Scripture was immediately
 addressed.

","Whether the Human Body Was Immediately Produced by God?
"," It would seem that the human body was not produced by God
 immediately. For Augustine says (De Trin. iii, 4), that ""corporeal
 things are disposed by God through the angels."" But the human body was
 made of corporeal matter, as stated above (A. 1). Therefore it
 was produced by the instrumentality of the angels, and not immediately
 by God.
"," Further, whatever can be made by a created power, is not
 necessarily produced immediately by God. But the human body can be
 produced by the created power of a heavenly body; for even certain
 animals are produced from putrefaction by the active power of a
 heavenly body; and Albumazar says that man is not generated where heat
 and cold are extreme, but only in temperate regions. Therefore the
 human body was not necessarily produced immediately by God.
"," Further, nothing is made of corporeal matter except by some
 material change. But all corporeal change is caused by a movement of
 a heavenly body, which is the first movement. Therefore, since the
 human body was produced from corporeal matter, it seems that a
 heavenly body had part in its production.
"," Further, Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. vii, 24) that man's
 body was made during the work of the six days, according to the
 causal virtues which God inserted in corporeal creatures; and that
 afterwards it was actually produced. But what pre-exists in the
 corporeal creature by reason of causal virtues can be produced by
 some corporeal body. Therefore the human body was produced by some
 created power, and not immediately by God.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," Although the angels are the ministers of God, as
 regards what He does in bodies, yet God does something in bodies
 beyond the angels' power, as, for instance, raising the dead, or
 giving sight to the blind: and by this power He formed the body of
 the first man from the slime of the earth. Nevertheless the angels
 could act as ministers in the formation of the body of the first man,
 in the same way as they will do at the last resurrection by
 collecting the dust.
"," Perfect animals, produced from seed, cannot be made by
 the sole power of a heavenly body, as Avicenna imagined; although the
 power of a heavenly body may assist by co-operation in the work of
 natural generation, as the Philosopher says (Phys. ii, 26), ""man and
 the sun beget man from matter."" For this reason, a place of moderate
 temperature is required for the production of man and other animals.
 But the power of heavenly bodies suffices for the production of some
 imperfect animals from properly disposed matter: for it is clear that
 more conditions are required to produce a perfect than an imperfect
 thing.
"," The movement of the heavens causes natural changes; but
 not changes that surpass the order of nature, and are caused by the
 Divine Power alone, as for the dead to be raised to life, or the
 blind to see: like to which also is the making of man from the slime
 of the earth.
"," An effect may be said to pre-exist in the causal
 virtues of creatures, in two ways. First, both in active and in
 passive potentiality, so that not only can it be produced out of
 pre-existing matter, but also that some pre-existing creature can
 produce it. Secondly, in passive potentiality only; that is, that out
 of pre-existing matter it can be produced by God. In this sense,
 according to Augustine, the human body pre-existed in the previous
 work in their causal virtues.

","Whether the Body of Man Was Given an Apt Disposition?
"," It would seem that the body of man was not given an apt
 disposition. For since man is the noblest of animals, his body ought
 to be the best disposed in what is proper to an animal, that is, in
 sense and movement. But some animals have sharper senses and quicker
 movement than man; thus dogs have a keener smell, and birds a swifter
 flight. Therefore man's body was not aptly disposed.
"," Further, perfect is what lacks nothing. But the human body
 lacks more than the body of other animals, for these are provided
 with covering and natural arms of defense, in which man is lacking.
 Therefore the human body is very imperfectly disposed.
"," Further, man is more distant from plants than he is from the
 brutes. But plants are erect in stature, while brutes are prone in
 stature. Therefore man should not be of erect stature.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The sense of touch, which is the foundation of the
 other senses, is more perfect in man than in any other animal; and
 for this reason man must have the most equable temperament of all
 animals. Moreover man excels all other animals in the interior
 sensitive powers, as is clear from what we have said above (Q. 78, A.
 4). But by a kind of necessity, man falls short of the other animals
 in some of the exterior senses; thus of all animals he has the least
 sense of smell. For man needs the largest brain as compared to the
 body; both for his greater freedom of action in the interior powers
 required for the intellectual operations, as we have seen above (Q.
 84, A. 7); and in order that the low temperature of the brain may
 modify the heat of the heart, which has to be considerable in man for
 him to be able to stand erect. So that size of the brain, by reason
 of its humidity, is an impediment to the smell, which requires
 dryness. In the same way, we may suggest a reason why some animals
 have a keener sight, and a more acute hearing than man; namely, on
 account of a hindrance to his senses arising necessarily from the
 perfect equability of his temperament. The same reason suffices to
 explain why some animals are more rapid in movement than man, since
 this excellence of speed is inconsistent with the equability of the
 human temperament.
"," Horns and claws, which are the weapons of some animals,
 and toughness of hide and quantity of hair or feathers, which are the
 clothing of animals, are signs of an abundance of the earthly
 element; which does not agree with the equability and softness of the
 human temperament. Therefore such things do not suit the nature of
 man. Instead of these, he has reason and hands whereby he can make
 himself arms and clothes, and other necessaries of life, of infinite
 variety. Wherefore the hand is called by Aristotle (De Anima iii, 8),
 ""the organ of organs."" Moreover this was more becoming to the
 rational nature, which is capable of conceiving an infinite number of
 things, so as to make for itself an infinite number of instruments.
"," An upright stature was becoming to man for four
 reasons. First, because the senses are given to man, not only for the
 purpose of procuring the necessaries of life, which they are bestowed
 on other animals, but also for the purpose of knowledge. Hence,
 whereas the other animals take delight in the objects of the senses
 only as ordered to food and sex, man alone takes pleasure in the
 beauty of sensible objects for its own sake. Therefore, as the senses
 are situated chiefly in the face, other animals have the face turned
 to the ground, as it were for the purpose of seeking food and
 procuring a livelihood; whereas man has his face erect, in order that
 by the senses, and chiefly by sight, which is more subtle and
 penetrates further into the differences of things, he may freely
 survey the sensible objects around him, both heavenly and earthly, so
 as to gather intelligible truth from all things. Secondly, for the
 greater freedom of the acts of the interior powers; the brain,
 wherein these actions are, in a way, performed, not being low down,
 but lifted up above other parts of the body. Thirdly, because if
 man's stature were prone to the ground he would need to use his hands
 as fore-feet; and thus their utility for other purposes would cease.
 Fourthly, because if man's stature were prone to the ground, and he
 used his hands as fore-feet, he would be obliged to take hold of his
 food with his mouth. Thus he would have a protruding mouth, with
 thick and hard lips, and also a hard tongue, so as to keep it from
 being hurt by exterior things; as we see in other animals. Moreover,
 such an attitude would quite hinder speech, which is reason's proper
 operation.

","Whether the Production of the Human Body Is Fittingly Described in
"," It would seem that the production of the human body is
 not fittingly described in Scripture. For, as the human body was made
 by God, so also were the other works of the six days. But in the other
 works it is written, ""God said; Let it be made, and it was made.""
 Therefore the same should have been said of man.
"," Further, the human body was made by God immediately, as
 explained above (A. 2). Therefore it was not fittingly said, ""Let us
 make man.""
"," Further, the form of the human body is the soul itself which
 is the breath of life. Therefore, having said, ""God made man of the
 slime of the earth,"" he should not have added: ""And He breathed into
 him the breath of life.""
"," Further, the soul, which is the breath of life, is in the
 whole body, and chiefly in the heart. Therefore it was not fittingly
 said: ""He breathed into his face the breath of life.""
"," Further, the male and female sex belong to the body, while
 the image of God belongs to the soul. But the soul, according to
 Augustine (Gen. ad lit. vii, 24), was made before the body. Therefore
 having said: ""To His image He made them,"" he should not have added,
 ""male and female He created them.""
",,,,,,,,,,,,," As Augustine observes (Gen. ad lit. vi, 12), man
 surpasses other things, not in the fact that God Himself made man,
 as though He did not make other things; since it is written (Ps.
 101:26), ""The work of Thy hands is the heaven,"" and elsewhere (Ps.
 94:5), ""His hands laid down the dry land""; but in this, that man is
 made to God's image. Yet in describing man's production, Scripture
 uses a special way of speaking, to show that other things were made
 for man's sake. For we are accustomed to do with more deliberation
 and care what we have chiefly in mind.
"," We must not imagine that when God said ""Let us make
 man,"" He spoke to the angels, as some were perverse enough to think.
 But by these words is signified the plurality of the Divine Person,
 Whose image is more clearly expressed in man.
"," Some have thought that man's body was formed first in
 priority of time, and that afterwards the soul was infused into the
 formed body. But it is inconsistent with the perfection of the
 production of things, that God should have made either the body
 without the soul, or the soul without the body, since each is a part
 of human nature. This is especially unfitting as regards the body,
 for the body depends on the soul, and not the soul on the body.
"," Since vital operations are more clearly seen in man's
 face, on account of the senses which are there expressed; therefore
 Scripture says that the breath of life was breathed into man's face.
"," According to Augustine (Gen. ad lit. iv, 34), the works
 of the six days were done all at one time; wherefore according to him
 man's soul, which he holds to have been made with the angels, was not
 made before the sixth day; but on the sixth day both the soul of the
 first man was made actually, and his body in its causal elements. But
 other doctors hold that on the sixth day both body and soul of man
 were actually made.

456,"[I, Q. 92, Art. 1]
","Whether the Woman Should Have Been Made in the First Production of
"," It would seem that the woman should not have been made
 in the first production of things. For the Philosopher says (De
 Gener. ii, 3), that ""the female is a misbegotten male."" But nothing
 misbegotten or defective should have been in the first production of
 things. Therefore woman should not have been made at that first
 production.
"," Further, subjection and limitation were a result of sin, for
 to the woman was it said after sin (Gen. 3:16): ""Thou shalt be under
 the man's power""; and Gregory says that, ""Where there is no sin,
 there is no inequality."" But woman is naturally of less strength and
 dignity than man; ""for the agent is always more honorable than the
 patient,"" as Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. xii, 16). Therefore woman
 should not have been made in the first production of things before
 sin.
"," Further, occasions of sin should be cut off. But God foresaw
 that the woman would be an occasion of sin to man. Therefore He
 should not have made woman.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," As regards the individual nature, woman is defective
 and misbegotten, for the active force in the male seed tends to the
 production of a perfect likeness in the masculine sex; while the
 production of woman comes from defect in the active force or from
 some material indisposition, or even from some external influence;
 such as that of a south wind, which is moist, as the Philosopher
 observes (De Gener. Animal. iv, 2). On the other hand, as regards
 human nature in general, woman is not misbegotten, but is included
 in nature's intention as directed to the work of generation. Now the
 general intention of nature depends on God, Who is the universal
 Author of nature. Therefore, in producing nature, God formed not
 only the male but also the female.
"," Subjection is twofold. One is servile, by virtue of
 which a superior makes use of a subject for his own benefit; and
 this kind of subjection began after sin. There is another kind of
 subjection which is called economic or civil, whereby the superior
 makes use of his subjects for their own benefit and good; and this
 kind of subjection existed even before sin. For good order would have
 been wanting in the human family if some were not governed by others
 wiser than themselves. So by such a kind of subjection woman is
 naturally subject to man, because in man the discretion of reason
 predominates. Nor is inequality among men excluded by the state of
 innocence, as we shall prove (Q. 96, A. 3).
"," If God had deprived the world of all those things which
 proved an occasion of sin, the universe would have been imperfect.
 Nor was it fitting for the common good to be destroyed in order that
 individual evil might be avoided; especially as God is so powerful
 that He can direct any evil to a good end.

457,"[I, Q. 92, Art. 2]
","Whether Woman Should Have Been Made from Man?
"," It would seem that woman should not have been made from
 man. For sex belongs both to man and animals. But in the other animals
 the female was not made from the male. Therefore neither should it
 have been so with man.
"," Further, things of the same species are of the same matter.
 But male and female are of the same species. Therefore, as man was
 made of the slime of the earth, so woman should have been made of the
 same, and not from man.
"," Further, woman was made to be a helpmate to man in the work
 of generation. But close relationship makes a person unfit for that
 office; hence near relations are debarred from intermarriage, as is
 written (Lev. 18:6). Therefore woman should not have been made from
 man.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Reply Obj. 1 is clear from the foregoing.
"," Matter is that from which something is made. Now
 created nature has a determinate principle; and since it is
 determined to one thing, it has also a determinate mode of
 proceeding. Wherefore from determinate matter it produces something
 in a determinate species. On the other hand, the Divine Power, being
 infinite, can produce things of the same species out of any matter,
 such as a man from the slime of the earth, and a woman from out of
 man.
"," A certain affinity arises from natural generation, and
 this is an impediment to matrimony. Woman, however, was not produced
 from man by natural generation, but by the Divine Power alone.
 Wherefore Eve is not called the daughter of Adam; and so this
 argument does not prove.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
458,"[I, Q. 92, Art. 3]
","Whether the Woman Was Fittingly Made from the Rib of Man?
"," It would seem that the woman should not have been formed
 from the rib of man. For the rib was much smaller than the woman's
 body. Now from a smaller thing a larger thing can be made
 only--either by addition (and then the woman ought to have been
 described as made out of that which was added, rather than out of the
 rib itself)--or by rarefaction, because, as Augustine says (Gen. ad
 lit. x): ""A body cannot increase in bulk except by rarefaction."" But
 the woman's body is not more rarefied than man's--at least, not in
 the proportion of a rib to Eve's body. Therefore Eve was not formed
 from a rib of Adam.
"," Further, in those things which were first created there was
 nothing superfluous. Therefore a rib of Adam belonged to the
 integrity of his body. So, if a rib was removed, his body remained
 imperfect; which is unreasonable to suppose.
"," Further, a rib cannot be removed from man without pain. But
 there was no pain before sin. Therefore it was not right for a rib
 to be taken from the man, that Eve might be made from it.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Some say that the woman's body was formed by a material
 increase, without anything being added; in the same way as our Lord
 multiplied the five loaves. But this is quite impossible. For such an
 increase of matter would either be by a change of the very substance
 of the matter itself, or by a change of its dimensions. Not by change
 of the substance of the matter, both because matter, considered in
 itself, is quite unchangeable, since it has a potential existence,
 and has nothing but the nature of a subject, and because quantity and
 size are extraneous to the essence of matter itself. Wherefore
 multiplication of matter is quite unintelligible, as long as the
 matter itself remains the same without anything added to it; unless
 it receives greater dimensions. This implies rarefaction, which is
 for the same matter to receive greater dimensions, as the Philosopher
 says (Phys. iv). To say, therefore, that the same matter is enlarged,
 without being rarefied, is to combine contradictories--viz. the
 definition with the absence of the thing defined.
"," The rib belonged to the integral perfection of Adam,
 not as an individual, but as the principle of the human race; just as
 the semen belongs to the perfection of the begetter, and is released
 by a natural and pleasurable operation. Much more, therefore, was it
 possible that by the Divine power the body of the woman should be
 produced from the man's rib.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
459,"[I, Q. 92, Art. 4]
","Whether the Woman Was Formed Immediately by God?
"," It would seem that the woman was not formed immediately
 by God. For no individual is produced immediately by God from another
 individual alike in species. But the woman was made from a man who is
 of the same species. Therefore she was not made immediately by God.
"," Further, Augustine (De Trin. iii, 4) says that corporeal
 things are governed by God through the angels. But the woman's body
 was formed from corporeal matter. Therefore it was made through the
 ministry of the angels, and not immediately by God.
"," Further, those things which pre-exist in creatures as to
 their causal virtues are produced by the power of some creature, and
 not immediately by God. But the woman's body was produced in its
 causal virtues among the first created works, as Augustine says (Gen.
 ad lit. ix, 15). Therefore it was not produced immediately by God.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," This argument is verified when an individual is
 begotten, by natural generation, from that which is like it in the
 same species.
"," As Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. ix, 15), we do not
 know whether the angels were employed by God in the formation of the
 woman; but it is certain that, as the body of man was not formed by
 the angels from the slime of the earth, so neither was the body of
 the woman formed by them from the man's rib.
"," As Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. ix, 18): ""The first
 creation of things did not demand that woman should be made thus; it
 made it possible for her to be thus made."" Therefore the body of the
 woman did indeed pre-exist in these causal virtues, in the things
 first created; not as regards active potentiality, but as regards a
 potentiality passive in relation to the active potentiality of the
 Creator.

","Whether the Image of God Is in Man?
"," It would seem that the image of God is not in man. For it
 is written (Isa. 40:18): ""To whom have you likened God? or what image
 will you make for Him?""
"," Further, to be the image of God is the property of the
 First-Begotten, of Whom the Apostle says (Col. 1:15): ""Who is the
 image of the invisible God, the First-Born of every creature.""
 Therefore the image of God is not to be found in man.
"," Further, Hilary says (De Synod [*Super i can]. Synod.
 Ancyr.) that ""an image is of the same species as that which it
 represents""; and he also says that ""an image is the undivided and
 united likeness of one thing adequately representing another."" But
 there is no species common to both God and man; nor can there be a
 comparison of equality between God and man. Therefore there can be no
 image of God in man.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The Prophet speaks of bodily images made by man.
 Therefore he says pointedly: ""What image will you make for Him?"" But
 God made a spiritual image to Himself in man.
"," The First-Born of creatures is the perfect Image of
 God, reflecting perfectly that of which He is the Image, and so He is
 said to be the ""Image,"" and never ""to the image."" But man is said to
 be both ""image"" by reason of the likeness; and ""to the image"" by
 reason of the imperfect likeness. And since the perfect likeness to
 God cannot be except in an identical nature, the Image of God exists
 in His first-born Son; as the image of the king is in his son, who is
 of the same nature as himself: whereas it exists in man as in an
 alien nature, as the image of the king is in a silver coin, as
 Augustine says explains in De decem Chordis (Serm. ix, al, xcvi, De
 Tempore).
"," As unity means absence of division, a species is said
 to be the same as far as it is one. Now a thing is said to be one not
 only numerically, specifically, or generically, but also according to
 a certain analogy or proportion. In this sense a creature is one with
 God, or like to Him; but when Hilary says ""of a thing which
 adequately represents another,"" this is to be understood of a perfect
 image.

","Whether the Image of God Is to Be Found in Irrational Creatures?
"," It would seem that the image of God is to be found in
 irrational creatures. For Dionysius says (Div. Nom. ii): ""Effects are
 contingent images of their causes."" But God is the cause not only of
 rational, but also of irrational creatures. Therefore the image of
 God is to be found in irrational creatures.
"," Further, the more distinct a likeness is, the nearer it
 approaches to the nature of an image. But Dionysius says (Div. Nom.
 iv) that ""the solar ray has a very great similitude to the Divine
 goodness."" Therefore it is made to the image of God.
"," Further, the more perfect anything is in goodness, the more
 it is like God. But the whole universe is more perfect in goodness
 than man; for though each individual thing is good, all things
 together are called ""very good"" (Gen. 1:31). Therefore the whole
 universe is to the image of God, and not only man.
"," Further, Boethius (De Consol. iii) says of God: ""Holding the
 world in His mind, and forming it into His image."" Therefore the
 whole world is to the image of God, and not only the rational
 creature.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," Everything imperfect is a participation of what is
 perfect. Therefore even what falls short of the nature of an image,
 so far as it possesses any sort of likeness to God, participates in
 some degree the nature of an image. So Dionysius says that effects
 are ""contingent images of their causes""; that is, as much as they
 happen (contingit) to be so, but not absolutely.
"," Dionysius compares the solar ray to Divine goodness, as
 regards its causality; not as regards its natural dignity which is
 involved in the idea of an image.
"," The universe is more perfect in goodness than the
 intellectual creature as regards extension and diffusion; but
 intensively and collectively the likeness to the Divine goodness is
 found rather in the intellectual creature, which has a capacity for
 the highest good. Or else we may say that a part is not rightly
 divided against the whole, but only against another part. Wherefore,
 when we say that the intellectual nature alone is to the image of
 God, we do not mean that the universe in any part is not to God's
 image, but that the other parts are excluded.
"," Boethius here uses the word ""image"" to express the
 likeness which the product of an art bears to the artistic species
 in the mind of the artist. Thus every creature is an image of the
 exemplar type thereof in the Divine mind. We are not, however, using
 the word ""image"" in this sense; but as it implies a likeness in
 nature, that is, inasmuch as all things, as being, are like to the
 First Being; as living, like to the First Life; and as intelligent,
 like to the Supreme Wisdom.

","Whether the Angels Are More to the Image of God Than Man Is?
"," It would seem that the angels are not more to the image
 of God than man is. For Augustine says in a sermon de Imagine xliii
 (de verbis Apost. xxvii) that God granted to no other creature
 besides man to be to His image. Therefore it is not true to say that
 the angels are more than man to the image of God.
"," Further, according to Augustine (QQ. 83, qu. 51), ""man is so
 much to God's image that God did not make any creature to be between
 Him and man: and therefore nothing is more akin to Him."" But a
 creature is called God's image so far as it is akin to God. Therefore
 the angels are not more to the image of God than man.
"," Further, a creature is said to be to God's image so far as it
 is of an intellectual nature. But the intellectual nature does not
 admit of intensity or remissness; for it is not an accidental thing,
 since it is a substance. Therefore the angels are not more to the
 image of God than man.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Augustine excludes the inferior creatures bereft of
 reason from the image of God; but not the angels.
"," As fire is said to be specifically the most subtle of
 bodies, while, nevertheless, one kind of fire is more subtle than
 another; so we say that nothing is more like to God than the human
 soul in its generic and intellectual nature, because as Augustine had
 said previously, ""things which have knowledge, are so near to Him in
 likeness that of all creatures none are nearer."" Wherefore this does
 not mean that the angels are not more to God's image.
"," When we say that substance does not admit of more or
 less, we do not mean that one species of substance is not more
 perfect than another; but that one and the same individual does not
 participate in its specific nature at one time more than at another;
 nor do we mean that a species of substance is shared among different
 individuals in a greater or lesser degree.

","Whether the Image of God Is Found in Every Man?
"," It would seem that the image of God is not found in every
 man. For the Apostle says that ""man is the image of God, but woman is
 the image [Vulg. glory] of man"" (1 Cor. 11:7). Therefore, as woman is
 an individual of the human species, it is clear that every individual
 is not an image of God.
"," Further, the Apostle says (Rom. 8:29): ""Whom God foreknew, He
 also predestined to be made conformable to the image of His Son."" But
 all men are not predestined. Therefore all men have not the
 conformity of image.
"," Further, likeness belongs to the nature of the image, as
 above explained (A. 1). But by sin man becomes unlike God. Therefore
 he loses the image of God.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The image of God, in its principal signification,
 namely the intellectual nature, is found both in man and in woman.
 Hence after the words, ""To the image of God He created him,"" it is
 added, ""Male and female He created them"" (Gen. 1:27). Moreover it is
 said ""them"" in the plural, as Augustine (Gen. ad lit. iii, 22)
 remarks, lest it should be thought that both sexes were united in one
 individual. But in a secondary sense the image of God is found in
 man, and not in woman: for man is the beginning and end of woman; as
 God is the beginning and end of every creature. So when the Apostle
 had said that ""man is the image and glory of God, but woman is the
 glory of man,"" he adds his reason for saying this: ""For man is not of
 woman, but woman of man; and man was not created for woman, but woman
 for man.""
"," These reasons refer to the image consisting in
 the conformity of grace and glory.

464,"[I, Q. 93, Art. 5]
","Whether the Image of God Is in Man According to the Trinity of
"," It would seem that the image of God does not exist in man
 as to the Trinity of Persons. For Augustine says (Fulgentius De Fide
 ad Petrum i): ""One in essence is the Godhead of the Holy Trinity; and
 one is the image to which man was made."" And Hilary (De Trin. v) says:
 ""Man is made to the image of that which is common in the Trinity.""
 Therefore the image of God in man is of the Divine Essence, and not of
 the Trinity of Persons.
"," Further, it is said (De Eccl. Dogmat.) that the image of God
 in man is to be referred to eternity. Damascene also says (De Fide
 Orth. ii, 12) that the image of God in man belongs to him as ""an
 intelligent being endowed with free-will and self-movement."" Gregory
 of Nyssa (De Homin. Opificio xvi) also asserts that, when Scripture
 says that ""man was made to the image of God, it means that human
 nature was made a participator of all good: for the Godhead is the
 fulness of goodness."" Now all these things belong more to the unity
 of the Essence than to the distinction of the Persons. Therefore the
 image of God in man regards, not the Trinity of Persons, but the
 unity of the Essence.
"," Further, an image leads to the knowledge of that of which it
 is the image. Therefore, if there is in man the image of God as to
 the Trinity of Persons; since man can know himself by his natural
 reason, it follows that by his natural knowledge man could know the
 Trinity of the Divine Persons; which is untrue, as was shown above
 (Q. 32, A. 1).
"," Further, the name of Image is not applicable to any of the
 Three Persons, but only to the Son; for Augustine says (De Trin. vi,
 2) that ""the Son alone is the image of the Father."" Therefore, if in
 man there were an image of God as regards the Person, this would not
 be an image of the Trinity, but only of the Son.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," This argument would avail if the image of God in man
 represented God in a perfect manner. But, as Augustine says (De Trin.
 xv, 6), there is a great difference between the trinity within
 ourselves and the Divine Trinity. Therefore, as he there says: ""We
 see, rather than believe, the trinity which is in ourselves; whereas
 we believe rather than see that God is Trinity.""
"," Some have said that in man there is an image of the Son
 only. Augustine rejects this opinion (De Trin. xii, 5,6). First,
 because as the Son is like to the Father by a likeness of essence, it
 would follow of necessity if man were made in likeness to the Son,
 that he is made to the likeness of the Father. Secondly, because if
 man were made only to the image of the Son, the Father would not have
 said, ""Let Us make man to Our own image and likeness""; but ""to Thy
 image."" When, therefore, it is written, ""He made him to the image of
 God,"" the sense is not that the Father made man to the image of the
 Son only, Who is God, as some explained it, but that the Divine
 Trinity made man to Its image, that is, of the whole Trinity. When it
 is said that God ""made man to His image,"" this can be understood in
 two ways: first, so that this preposition ""to"" points to the term of
 the making, and then the sense is, ""Let Us make man in such a way
 that Our image may be in him."" Secondly, this preposition 'to' may
 point to the exemplar cause, as when we say, ""This book is made
 (like) to that one."" Thus the image of God is the very Essence of
 God, Which is incorrectly called an image forasmuch as image is put
 for the exemplar. Or, as some say, the Divine Essence is called an
 image because thereby one Person imitates another.

","Whether the Image of God Is in Man As Regards the Mind Only?
"," It would seem that the image of God is not only in
 man's mind. For the Apostle says (1 Cor. 11:7) that ""the man is the
 image . . . of God."" But man is not only mind. Therefore the image
 of God is to be observed not only in his mind.
"," Further, it is written (Gen. 1:27): ""God created man to His
 own image; to the image of God He created him; male and female He
 created them."" But the distinction of male and female is in the body.
 Therefore the image of God is also in the body, and not only in the
 mind.
"," Further, an image seems to apply principally to the shape of
 a thing. But shape belongs to the body. Therefore the image of God
 is to be seen in man's body also, and not in his mind.
"," Further, according to Augustine (Gen. ad lit. xii, 7,24)
 there is a threefold vision in us, ""corporeal,"" ""spiritual,"" or
 imaginary, and ""intellectual."" Therefore, if in the intellectual
 vision that belongs to the mind there exists in us a trinity by
 reason of which we are made to the image of God, for the like
 reason there must be another trinity in the others.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," Man is called to the image of God; not that he is
 essentially an image; but that the image of God is impressed on his
 mind; as a coin is an image of the king, as having the image of the
 king. Wherefore there is no need to consider the image of God as
 existing in every part of man.
"," As Augustine says (De Trin. xii, 5), some have thought
 that the image of God was not in man individually, but severally.
 They held that ""the man represents the Person of the Father; those
 born of man denote the person of the Son; and that the woman is a
 third person in likeness to the Holy Ghost, since she so proceeded
 from man as not to be his son or daughter."" All of this is manifestly
 absurd; first, because it would follow that the Holy Ghost is the
 principle of the Son, as the woman is the principle of the man's
 offspring; secondly, because one man would be only the image of one
 Person; thirdly, because in that case Scripture should not have
 mentioned the image of God in man until after the birth of the
 offspring. Therefore we must understand that when Scripture had said,
 ""to the image of God He created him,"" it added, ""male and female He
 created them,"" not to imply that the image of God came through the
 distinction of sex, but that the image of God belongs to both sexes,
 since it is in the mind, wherein there is no sexual distinction.
 Wherefore the Apostle (Col. 3:10), after saying, ""According to the
 image of Him that created him,"" added, ""Where there is neither male
 nor female"" [*these words are in reality from Gal. 3:28] (Vulg.
 ""neither Gentile nor Jew"").
"," Although the image of God in man is not to be found in
 his bodily shape, yet because ""the body of man alone among
 terrestrial animals is not inclined prone to the ground, but is
 adapted to look upward to heaven, for this reason we may rightly say
 that it is made to God's image and likeness, rather than the bodies
 of other animals,"" as Augustine remarks (QQ. 83, qu. 51). But this is
 not to be understood as though the image of God were in man's body;
 but in the sense that the very shape of the human body represents the
 image of God in the soul by way of a trace.
"," Both in the corporeal and in the imaginary vision we
 may find a trinity, as Augustine says (De Trin. xi, 2). For in
 corporeal vision there is first the species of the exterior body;
 secondly, the act of vision, which occurs by the impression on the
 sight of a certain likeness of the said species; thirdly, the
 intention of the will applying the sight to see, and to rest on what
 is seen.

466,"[I, Q. 93, Art. 7]
","Whether the Image of God Is to Be Found in the Acts of the Soul?
"," It would seem that the image of God is not found in the
 acts of the soul. For Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xi, 26), that ""man
 was made to God's image, inasmuch as we exist and know that we exist,
 and love this existence and knowledge."" But to exist does not signify
 an act. Therefore the image of God is not to be found in the soul's
 acts.
"," Further, Augustine (De Trin. ix, 4) assigns God's image in
 the soul to these three things--mind, knowledge, and love. But mind
 does not signify an act, but rather the power or the essence of the
 intellectual soul. Therefore the image of God does not extend to the
 acts of the soul.
"," Further, Augustine (De Trin. x, 11) assigns the image of the
 Trinity in the soul to ""memory, understanding, and will."" But these
 three are ""natural powers of the soul,"" as the Master of the
 Sentences says (1 Sent. D iii). Therefore the image of God is in the
 powers, and does not extend to the acts of the soul.
"," Further, the image of the Trinity always remains in the soul.
 But an act does not always remain. Therefore the image of God does
 not extend to the acts.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," Our being bears the image of God so far as it is proper
 to us, and excels that of the other animals, that is to say, in so
 far as we are endowed with a mind. Therefore, this trinity is the
 same as that which Augustine mentions (De Trin. ix, 4), and which
 consists in mind, knowledge, and love.
"," Augustine observed this trinity, first, as existing in
 the mind. But because the mind, though it knows itself entirely in a
 certain degree, yet also in a way does not know itself--namely, as
 being distinct from others (and thus also it searches itself, as
 Augustine subsequently proves--De Trin. x, 3,4); therefore, as though
 knowledge were not in equal proportion to mind, he takes three things
 in the soul which are proper to the mind, namely, memory,
 understanding, and will; which everyone is conscious of possessing;
 and assigns the image of the Trinity pre-eminently to these three, as
 though the first assignation were in part deficient.
"," As Augustine proves (De Trin. xiv, 7), we may be said
 to understand, will, and to love certain things, both when we
 actually consider them, and when we do not think of them. When they
 are not under our actual consideration, they are objects of our
 memory only, which, in his opinion, is nothing else than habitual
 retention of knowledge and love [*Cf. Q. 79, A. 7, ad 1]. ""But
 since,"" as he says, ""a word cannot be there without actual thought
 (for we think everything that we say, even if we speak with that
 interior word belonging to no nation's tongue), this image chiefly
 consists in these three things, memory, understanding, and will. And
 by understanding I mean here that whereby we understand with actual
 thought; and by will, love, or dilection I mean that which unites
 this child with its parent."" From which it is clear that he places
 the image of the Divine Trinity more in actual understanding and
 will, than in these as existing in the habitual retention of the
 memory; although even thus the image of the Trinity exists in the
 soul in a certain degree, as he says in the same place. Thus it is
 clear that memory, understanding, and will are not three powers as
 stated in the Sentences.
"," Someone might answer by referring to Augustine's
 statement (De Trin. xiv, 6), that ""the mind ever remembers itself,
 ever understands itself, ever loves itself""; which some take to mean
 that the soul ever actually understands, and loves itself. But he
 excludes this interpretation by adding that ""it does not always think
 of itself as actually distinct from other things."" Thus it is clear
 that the soul always understands and loves itself, not actually but
 habitually; though we might say that by perceiving its own act, it
 understands itself whenever it understands anything. But since it is
 not always actually understanding, as in the case of sleep, we must
 say that these acts, although not always actually existing, yet ever
 exist in their principles, the habits and powers. Wherefore,
 Augustine says (De Trin. xiv, 4): ""If the rational soul is made to
 the image of God in the sense that it can make use of reason and
 intellect to understand and consider God, then the image of God was
 in the soul from the beginning of its existence.""
",,,,,,,,,,,,
467,"[I, Q. 93, Art. 8]
","Whether the Image of the Divine Trinity Is in the Soul Only by
"," It would seem that the image of the Divine Trinity is in
 the soul not only by comparison with God as its object. For the image
 of the Divine Trinity is to be found in the soul, as shown above (A.
 7), according as the word in us proceeds from the speaker; and love
 from both. But this is to be found in us as regards any object.
 Therefore the image of the Divine Trinity is in our mind as regards
 any object.
"," Further, Augustine says (De Trin. xii, 4) that ""when we seek
 trinity in the soul, we seek it in the whole of the soul, without
 separating the process of reasoning in temporal matters from the
 consideration of things eternal."" Therefore the image of the Trinity
 is to be found in the soul, even as regards temporal objects.
"," Further, it is by grace that we can know and love God. If,
 therefore, the image of the Trinity is found in the soul by reason of
 the memory, understanding, and will or love of God, this image is not
 in man by nature but by grace, and thus is not common to all.
"," Further, the saints in heaven are most perfectly conformed to
 the image of God by the beatific vision; wherefore it is written (2
 Cor. 3:18): ""We . . . are transformed into the same image from glory
 to glory."" But temporal things are known by the beatific vision.
 Therefore the image of God exists in us even according to temporal
 things.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," For the notion of an image it is not enough that
 something proceed from another, but it is also necessary to observe
 what proceeds and whence it proceeds; namely, that what is Word of
 God proceeds from knowledge of God.
"," In all the soul we may see a kind of trinity,
 not, however, as though besides the action of temporal things and the
 contemplation of eternal things, ""any third thing should be required
 to make up the trinity,"" as he adds in the same passage. But in that
 part of the reason which is concerned with temporal things, ""although
 a trinity may be found; yet the image of God is not to be seen there,""
 as he says farther on; forasmuch as this knowledge of temporal things
 is adventitious to the soul. Moreover even the habits whereby temporal
 things are known are not always present; but sometimes they are
 actually present, and sometimes present only in memory even after they
 begin to exist in the soul. Such is clearly the case with faith, which
 comes to us temporally for this present life; while in the future life
 faith will no longer exist, but only the remembrance of faith.
"," The meritorious knowledge and love of God can be
 in us only by grace. Yet there is a certain natural knowledge and love
 as seen above (Q. 12, A. 12; Q. 56, A. 3; Q. 60, A. 5).
 This, too, is natural that the mind, in order to understand God, can
 make use of reason, in which sense we have already said that the image
 of God abides ever in the soul; ""whether this image of God be so
 obsolete,"" as it were clouded, ""as almost to amount to nothing,"" as in
 those who have not the use of reason; ""or obscured and disfigured,"" as
 in sinners; or ""clear and beautiful,"" as in the just; as Augustine
 says (De Trin. xiv, 6).
"," By the vision of glory temporal things will be
 seen in God Himself; and such a vision of things temporal will belong
 to the image of God. This is what Augustine means (De Trin. xiv, 6),
 when he says that ""in that nature to which the mind will blissfully
 adhere, whatever it sees it will see as unchangeable""; for in the
 Uncreated Word are the types of all creatures.

468,"[I, Q. 93, Art. 9]
","Whether ""Likeness"" Is Properly Distinguished from ""Image""?
"," It would seem that ""likeness"" is not properly
 distinguished from ""image."" For genus is not properly distinguished
 from species. Now, ""likeness"" is to ""image"" as genus to species:
 because, ""where there is image, forthwith there is likeness, but not
 conversely"" as Augustine says (QQ. 83, qu. 74). Therefore ""likeness""
 is not properly to be distinguished from ""image.""
"," Further, the nature of the image consists not only in the
 representation of the Divine Persons, but also in the representation
 of the Divine Essence, to which representation belong immortality and
 indivisibility. So it is not true to say that the ""likeness is in the
 essence because it is immortal and indivisible; whereas the image is
 in other things"" (Sent. ii, D, xvi).
"," Further, the image of God in man is threefold--the image of
 nature, of grace, and of glory, as above explained (A. 4). But
 innocence and righteousness belong to grace. Therefore it is
 incorrectly said (Sent. ii, D, xvi) ""that the image is taken from the
 memory, the understanding and the will, while the likeness is from
 innocence and righteousness.""
"," Further, knowledge of truth belongs to the intellect, and
 love of virtue to the will; which two things are parts of the image.
 Therefore it is incorrect to say (Sent. ii, D, xvi) that ""the image
 consists in the knowledge of truth, and the likeness in the love of
 virtue.""
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," ""Likeness"" is not distinct from ""image"" in the general
 notion of ""likeness"" (for thus it is included in ""image""); but so far
 as any ""likeness"" falls short of ""image,"" or again, as it perfects
 the idea of ""image.""
"," The soul's essence belongs to the ""image,"" as
 representing the Divine Essence in those things which belong to the
 intellectual nature; but not in those conditions subsequent to
 general notions of being, such as simplicity and indissolubility.
"," Even certain virtues are natural to the soul, at least,
 in their seeds, by reason of which we may say that a natural
 ""likeness"" exists in the soul. Nor it is unfitting to us the term
 ""image"" from one point of view and from another the term ""likeness.""
"," Love of the word, which is knowledge loved, belongs to
 the nature of ""image""; but love of virtue belongs to ""likeness,"" as
 virtue itself belongs to likeness.

","Whether the First Man Saw God Through His Essence?
"," It would seem that the first man saw God through His
 Essence. For man's happiness consists in the vision of the Divine
 Essence. But the first man, ""while established in paradise, led a
 life of happiness in the enjoyment of all things,"" as Damascene says
 (De Fide Orth. ii, 11). And Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 10): ""If
 man was gifted with the same tastes as now, how happy must he have
 been in paradise, that place of ineffable happiness!"" Therefore the
 first man in paradise saw God through His Essence.
"," Further, Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xiv, loc. cit.) that
 ""the first man lacked nothing which his good-will might obtain."" But
 our good-will can obtain nothing better than the vision of the Divine
 Essence. Therefore man saw God through His Essence.
"," Further, the vision of God in His Essence is whereby God is
 seen without a medium or enigma. But man in the state of innocence
 ""saw God immediately,"" as the Master of the Sentences asserts (Sent.
 iv, D, i). He also saw without an enigma, for an enigma implies
 obscurity, as Augustine says (De Trin. xv, 9). Now, obscurity
 resulted from sin. Therefore man in the primitive state saw God
 through His Essence.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Man was happy in paradise, but not with that perfect
 happiness to which he was destined, which consists in the vision of
 the Divine Essence. He was, however, endowed with ""a life of
 happiness in a certain measure,"" as Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. xi,
 18), so far as he was gifted with natural integrity and perfection.
"," A good will is a well-ordered will; but the will of the
 first man would have been ill-ordered had he wished to have, while in
 the state of merit, what had been promised to him as a reward.
"," A medium (of knowledge) is twofold; one through which,
 and, at the same time, in which, something is seen, as, for example,
 a man is seen through a mirror, and is seen with the mirror: another
 kind of medium is that whereby we attain to the knowledge of
 something unknown; such as the medium in a demonstration. God was
 seen without this second kind of medium, but not without the first
 kind. For there was no need for the first man to attain to the
 knowledge of God by demonstration drawn from an effect, such as we
 need; since he knew God simultaneously in His effects, especially in
 the intelligible effects, according to His capacity. Again, we must
 remark that the obscurity which is implied in the word enigma may be
 of two kinds: first, so far as every creature is something obscure
 when compared with the immensity of the Divine light; and thus Adam
 saw God in an enigma, because he saw Him in a created effect:
 secondly, we may take obscurity as an effect of sin, so far as man is
 impeded in the consideration of intelligible things by being
 preoccupied with sensible things; in which sense Adam did not see God
 in an enigma.

","Whether Adam in the State of Innocence Saw the Angels Through Their
"," It would seem that Adam, in the state of innocence, saw
 the angels through their essence. For Gregory says (Dialog. iv, 1):
 ""In paradise man was accustomed to enjoy the words of God; and by
 purity of heart and loftiness of vision to have the company of the
 good angels.""
"," Further, the soul in the present state is impeded from the
 knowledge of separate substances by union with a corruptible body
 which ""is a load upon the soul,"" as is written Wis. 9:15. Wherefore
 the separate soul can see separate substances, as above explained
 (Q. 89, A. 2). But the body of the first man was not a load upon his
 soul; for the latter was not corruptible. Therefore he was able to
 see separate substances.
"," Further, one separate substance knows another separate
 substance, by knowing itself (De Causis xiii). But the soul of the
 first man knew itself. Therefore it knew separate substances.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," That the soul of the first man fell short of the
 knowledge regarding separate substances, was not owing to the fact
 that the body was a load upon it; but to the fact that its connatural
 object fell short of the excellence of separate substances. We, in
 our present state, fall short on account of both these reasons.
"," The soul of the first man was not able to arrive at
 knowledge of separate substances by means of its self-knowledge, as
 we have shown above; for even each separate substance knows others
 in its own measure.

471,"[I, Q. 94, Art. 3]
","Whether the First Man Knew All Things?
"," It would seem that the first man did not know all
 things. For if he had such knowledge it would be either by acquired
 species, or by connatural species, or by infused species. Not,
 however, by acquired species; for this kind of knowledge is acquired
 by experience, as stated in Metaph. i, 1; and the first man had not
 then gained experience of all things. Nor through connatural species,
 because he was of the same nature as we are; and our soul, as
 Aristotle says (De Anima iii, 4), is ""like a clean tablet on which
 nothing is written."" And if his knowledge came by infused species, it
 would have been of a different kind from ours, which we acquire from
 things themselves.
"," Further, individuals of the same species have the same way of
 arriving at perfection. Now other men have not, from the beginning,
 knowledge of all things, but they acquire it in the course of time
 according to their capacity. Therefore neither did Adam know all
 things when he was first created.
"," Further, the present state of life is given to man in order
 that his soul may advance in knowledge and merit; indeed, the soul
 seems to be united to the body for that purpose. Now man would have
 advanced in merit in that state of life; therefore also in knowledge.
 Therefore he was not endowed with knowledge of all things.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The first man had knowledge of all things by divinely
 infused species. Yet his knowledge was not different from ours; as
 the eyes which Christ gave to the man born blind were not different
 from those given by nature.
"," To Adam, as being the first man, was due a degree of
 perfection which was not due to other men, as is clear from what is
 above explained.
"," Adam would have advanced in natural knowledge, not in
 the number of things known, but in the manner of knowing; because
 what he knew speculatively he would subsequently have known by
 experience. But as regards supernatural knowledge, he would also have
 advanced as regards the number of things known, by further
 revelation; as the angels advance by further enlightenment. Moreover
 there is no comparison between advance in knowledge and advance in
 merit; since one man cannot be a principle of merit to another,
 although he can be to another a principle of knowledge.

","Whether Man in His First State Could Be Deceived?
"," It would seem that man in his primitive state could have
 been deceived. For the Apostle says (1 Tim. 2:14) that ""the woman
 being seduced was in the transgression.""
"," Further, the Master says (Sent. ii, D, xxi) that, ""the woman
 was not frightened at the serpent speaking, because she thought that
 he had received the faculty of speech from God."" But this was untrue.
 Therefore before sin the woman was deceived.
"," Further, it is natural that the farther off anything is from
 us, the smaller it seems to be. Now, the nature of the eyes is not
 changed by sin. Therefore this would have been the case in the state
 of innocence. Wherefore man would have been deceived in the size of
 what he saw, just as he is deceived now.
"," Further, Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. xii, 2) that, in sleep
 the soul adheres to the images of things as if they were the things
 themselves. But in the state of innocence man would have eaten and
 consequently have slept and dreamed. Therefore he would have been
 deceived, adhering to images as to realities.
"," Further, the first man would have been ignorant of other
 men's thoughts, and of future contingent events, as stated above
 (A. 3). So if anyone had told him what was false about these things,
 he would have been deceived.
",,,,,,,,,,,,," Though the woman was deceived before she sinned in
 deed, still it was not till she had already sinned by interior pride.
 For Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. xi, 30) that ""the woman could not
 have believed the words of the serpent, had she not already
 acquiesced in the love of her own power, and in a presumption of
 self-conceit.""
"," The woman thought that the serpent had received this
 faculty, not as acting in accordance with nature, but by virtue of
 some supernatural operation. We need not, however, follow the Master
 of the Sentences in this point.
"," Were anything presented to the imagination or sense of
 the first man, not in accordance with the nature of things, he would
 not have been deceived, for his reason would have enabled him to
 judge the truth.
"," A man is not accountable for what occurs during sleep;
 as he has not then the use of his reason, wherein consists man's
 proper action.
"," If anyone had said something untrue as regards future
 contingencies, or as regards secret thoughts, man in the primitive

","Whether the First Man Was Created in Grace?
"," It would seem that the first man was not created in
 grace. For the Apostle, distinguishing between Adam and Christ, says
 (1 Cor. 15:45): ""The first Adam was made into a living soul; the last
 Adam into a quickening spirit."" But the spirit is quickened by grace.
 Therefore Christ alone was made in grace.
"," Further, Augustine says (QQ. Vet. et Nov. Test., qu. 123)
 [*Work of an anonymous author, among the supposititious works of St.
 Augustine] that ""Adam did not possess the Holy Ghost."" But whoever
 possesses grace has the Holy Ghost. Therefore Adam was not created in
 grace.
"," Further, Augustine says (De Correp. et Grat. x) that ""God so
 ordered the life of the angels and men, as to show first what they
 could do by free-will, then what they could do by His grace, and by
 the discernment of righteousness."" God thus first created men and
 angels in the state of natural free-will only; and afterwards
 bestowed grace on them.
"," Further, the Master says (Sent. ii, D, xxiv): ""When man was
 created he was given sufficient help to stand, but not sufficient to
 advance."" But whoever has grace can advance by merit. Therefore the
 first man was not created in grace.
"," Further, the reception of grace requires the consent of the
 recipient, since thereby a kind of spiritual marriage takes place
 between God and the soul. But consent presupposes existence.
 Therefore man did not receive grace in the first moment of his
 creation.
"," Further, nature is more distant from grace than grace is from
 glory, which is but grace consummated. But in man grace precedes
 glory. Therefore much more did nature precede grace.
",,,,,,,,,,,," The Apostle in these words means to show that there
 is a spiritual body, if there is an animal body, inasmuch as the
 spiritual life of the body began in Christ, who is ""the firstborn
 of the dead,"" as the body's animal life began in Adam. From the
 Apostle's words, therefore, we cannot gather that Adam had no
 spiritual life in his soul; but that he had not spiritual life as
 regards the body.
"," As Augustine says in the same passage, it is not
 disputed that Adam, like other just souls, was in some degree gifted
 with the Holy Ghost; but ""he did not possess the Holy Ghost, as the
 faithful possess Him now,"" who are admitted to eternal happiness
 directly after death.
"," This passage from Augustine does not assert that angels
 or men were created with natural free-will before they possessed
 grace; but that God shows first what their free-will could do before
 being confirmed in grace, and what they acquired afterwards by being
 so confirmed.
"," The Master here speaks according to the opinion of
 those who held that man was not created in grace, but only in a state
 of nature. We may also say that, though man was created in grace, yet
 it was not by virtue of the nature wherein he was created that he
 could advance by merit, but by virtue of the grace which was added.
"," As the motion of the will is not continuous there is
 nothing against the first man having consented to grace even in the
 first moment of his existence.
"," We merit glory by an act of grace; but we do not merit
 grace by an act of nature; hence the comparison fails.

 Therefore in the state of innocence there were no passions of the

 impassible as regards the passions which impede the free use of

","Whether Adam Had All the Virtues?
"," It would seem that Adam had not all the virtues. For
 some virtues are directed to curb passions: thus immoderate
 concupiscence is restrained by temperance, and immoderate fear by
 fortitude. But in the state of innocence no immoderation existed
 in the passions. Therefore neither did these virtues then exist.
"," Further, some virtues are concerned with the passions which
 have evil as their object; as meekness with anger; fortitude with
 fear. But these passions did not exist in the state of innocence, as
 stated above (A. 2). Therefore neither did those virtues exist then.
"," Further, penance is a virtue that regards sin committed.
 Mercy, too, is a virtue concerned with unhappiness. But in the state
 of innocence neither sin nor unhappiness existed. Therefore neither
 did those virtues exist.
"," Further, perseverance is a virtue. But Adam possessed it not;
 as proved by his subsequent sin. Therefore he possessed not every
 virtue.
"," Further, faith is a virtue. But it did not exist in the state
 of innocence; for it implies an obscurity of knowledge which seems to
 be incompatible with the perfection of the primitive state.
",,,,,,,,,,,,," It is accidental to temperance and fortitude to subdue
 superabundant passion, in so far as they are in a subject which
 happens to have superabundant passions, and yet those virtues are
 per se competent to moderate the passions.
"," Passions which have evil for their object were
 incompatible with the perfection of the primitive state, if that evil
 be in the one affected by the passion; such as fear and sorrow. But
 passions which relate to evil in another are not incompatible with
 the perfection of the primitive state; for in that state man could
 hate the demons' malice, as he could love God's goodness. Thus the
 virtues which relate to such passions could exist in the primitive
 state, in habit and in act. Virtues, however, relating to passions
 which regard evil in the same subject, if relating to such passions
 only, could not exist in the primitive state in act, but only in
 habit, as we have said above of penance and of mercy. But other
 virtues there are which have relation not to such passions only, but
 to others; such as temperance, which relates not only to sorrow, but
 also to joy; and fortitude, which relates not only to fear, but also
 to daring and hope. Thus the act of temperance could exist in the
 primitive state, so far as it moderates pleasure; and in like manner,
 fortitude, as moderating daring and hope, but not as moderating
 sorrow and fear.

"," Perseverance may be taken in two ways: in one sense as
 a particular virtue, signifying a habit whereby a man makes a choice
 of persevering in good; in that sense Adam possessed perseverance. In
 another sense it is taken as a circumstance of virtue; signifying a
 certain uninterrupted continuation of virtue; in which sense Adam did
 not possess perseverance.

","Whether the Actions of the First Man Were Less Meritorious Than Ours
"," It would seem that the actions of the first man were
 less meritorious than ours are. For grace is given to us through the
 mercy of God, Who succors most those who are most in need. Now we are
 more in need of grace than was man in the state of innocence.
 Therefore grace is more copiously poured out upon us; and since grace
 is the source of merit, our actions are more meritorious.
"," Further, struggle and difficulty are required for merit; for
 it is written (2 Tim. 2:5): ""He . . . is not crowned except he strive
 lawfully"" and the Philosopher says (Ethic. ii, 3): ""The object of
 virtue is the difficult and the good."" But there is more strife and
 difficulty now. Therefore there is greater efficacy for merit.
"," Further, the Master says (Sent. ii., D, xxiv) that ""man would
 not have merited in resisting temptation; whereas he does merit now,
 when he resists."" Therefore our actions are more meritorious than in
 the primitive state.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," After sin man requires grace for more things than
 before sin; but he does not need grace more; forasmuch as man even
 before sin required grace to obtain eternal life, which is the chief
 reason for the need of grace. But after sin man required grace also
 for the remission of sin, and for the support of his weakness.
"," Difficulty and struggle belong to the degree of merit
 according to the proportionate degree of the work done, as above
 explained. It is also a sign of the will's promptitude striving after
 what is difficult to itself: and the promptitude of the will is
 caused by the intensity of charity. Yet it may happen that a person
 performs an easy deed with as prompt a will as another performs an
 arduous deed; because he is ready to do even what may be difficult to
 him. But the actual difficulty, by its penal character, enables the
 deed to satisfy for sin.
"," The first man would not have gained merit in resisting
 temptation, according to the opinion of those who say that he did not
 possess grace; even as now there is no merit to those who have not
 grace. But in this point there is a difference, inasmuch as in the
 primitive state there was no interior impulse to evil, as in our
 present state. Hence man was more able then than now to resist
 temptation even without grace.

","Whether Adam in the State of Innocence Had Mastership Over the
"," It would seem that in the state of innocence Adam had
 no mastership over the animals. For Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. ix,
 14), that the animals were brought to Adam, under the direction of
 the angels, to receive their names from him. But the angels need not
 have intervened thus, if man himself were master over the animals.
 Therefore in the state of innocence man had no mastership of the
 animals.
"," Further, it is unfitting that elements hostile to one another
 should be brought under the mastership of one. But many animals are
 hostile to one another, as the sheep and the wolf. Therefore all
 animals were not brought under the mastership of man.
"," Further, Jerome says [*The words quoted are not in St.
 Jerome's works. St. Thomas may have had in mind Bede, Hexaem., as
 quoted in the Glossa ordinaria on Gen. 1:26]: ""God gave man
 mastership over the animals, although before sin he had no need of
 them: for God foresaw that after sin animals would become useful to
 man."" Therefore, at least before sin, it was unfitting for man to
 make use of his mastership.
"," Further, it is proper to a master to command. But a command
 is not given rightly save to a rational being. Therefore man had no
 mastership over the irrational animals.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," A higher power can do many things that an inferior
 power cannot do to those which are subject to them. Now an angel is
 naturally higher than man. Therefore certain things in regard to
 animals could be done by angels, which could not be done by man; for
 instance, the rapid gathering together of all the animals.
"," In the opinion of some, those animals which now are
 fierce and kill others, would, in that state, have been tame, not
 only in regard to man, but also in regard to other animals. But this
 is quite unreasonable. For the nature of animals was not changed by
 man's sin, as if those whose nature now it is to devour the flesh of
 others, would then have lived on herbs, as the lion and falcon. Nor
 does Bede's gloss on Gen. 1:30, say that trees and herbs were given
 as food to all animals and birds, but to some. Thus there would have
 been a natural antipathy between some animals. They would not,
 however, on this account have been excepted from the mastership of
 man: as neither at present are they for that reason excepted from the
 mastership of God, Whose Providence has ordained all this. Of this
 Providence man would have been the executor, as appears even now in
 regard to domestic animals, since fowls are given by men as food to
 the trained falcon.
"," In the state of innocence man would not have had any
 bodily need of animals--neither for clothing, since then they were
 naked and not ashamed, there being no inordinate motions of
 concupiscence--nor for food, since they fed on the trees of
 paradise--nor to carry him about, his body being strong enough for
 that purpose. But man needed animals in order to have experimental
 knowledge of their natures. This is signified by the fact that God
 led the animals to man, that he might give them names expressive of
 their respective natures.
"," All animals by their natural instinct have a certain
 participation of prudence and reason: which accounts for the fact
 that cranes follow their leader, and bees obey their queen. So all
 animals would have obeyed man of their own accord, as in the present
 state some domestic animals obey him.

","Whether Man Had Mastership Over All Other Creatures?
"," It would seem that in the state of innocence man would
 not have had mastership over all other creatures. For an angel
 naturally has a greater power than man. But, as Augustine says (De
 Trin. iii, 8), ""corporeal matter would not have obeyed even the holy
 angels."" Much less therefore would it have obeyed man in the state
 of innocence.
"," Further, the only powers of the soul existing in plants are
 nutritive, augmentative, and generative. Now these do not naturally
 obey reason; as we can see in the case of any one man. Therefore,
 since it is by his reason that man is competent to have mastership,
 it seems that in the state of innocence man had no dominion over
 plants.
"," Further, whosoever is master of a thing, can change it. But
 man could not have changed the course of the heavenly bodies; for
 this belongs to God alone, as Dionysius says (Ep. ad Polycarp. vii).
 Therefore man had no dominion over them.

","Whether Men Were Equal in the State of Innocence?
"," It would seem that in the state of innocence all would
 have been equal. For Gregory says (Moral. xxi): ""Where there is no
 sin, there is no inequality."" But in the state of innocence there
 was no sin. Therefore all were equal.
"," Further, likeness and equality are the basis of mutual love,
 according to Ecclus. 13:19, ""Every beast loveth its like; so also
 every man him that is nearest to himself."" Now in that state there
 was among men an abundance of love, which is the bond of peace.
 Therefore all were equal in the state of innocence.
"," Further, the cause ceasing, the effect also ceases. But the
 cause of present inequality among men seems to arise, on the part of
 God, from the fact that He rewards some and punishes others; and on
 the part of nature, from the fact that some, through a defect of
 nature, are born weak and deficient, others strong and perfect, which
 would not have been the case in the primitive state. Therefore, etc.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," By those words Gregory means to exclude such inequality
 as exists between virtue and vice; the result of which is that some
 are placed in subjection to others as a penalty.
"," Equality is the cause of equality in mutual love. Yet
 between those who are unequal there can be a greater love than
 between equals; although there be not an equal response: for a father
 naturally loves his son more than a brother loves his brother;
 although the son does not love his father as much as he is loved by
 him.
"," The cause of inequality could be on the part of God;
 not indeed that He would punish some and reward others, but that He
 would exalt some above others; so that the beauty of order would the
 more shine forth among men. Inequality might also arise on the part
 of nature as above described, without any defect of nature.

"," It would seem that in the state of innocence man would
 not have been master over man. For Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xix,
 15): ""God willed that man, who was endowed with reason and made to His
 image, should rule over none but irrational creatures; not over men,
 but over cattle.""
"," Further, what came into the world as a penalty for sin would
 not have existed in the state of innocence. But man was made subject
 to man as a penalty; for after sin it was said to the woman (Gen.
 3:16): ""Thou shalt be under thy husband's power."" Therefore in the
 state of innocence man would not have been subject to man.
"," Further, subjection is opposed to liberty. But liberty is one
 of the chief blessings, and would not have been lacking in the state
 of innocence, ""where nothing was wanting that man's good-will could
 desire,"" as Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 10). Therefore man would
 not have been master over man in the state of innocence.

","Whether in the State of Innocence Man Would Have Been Immortal?
"," It would seem that in the state of innocence man was not
 immortal. For the term ""mortal"" belongs to the definition of man. But
 if you take away the definition, you take away the thing defined.
 Therefore as long as man was man he could not be immortal.
"," Further, corruptible and incorruptible are generically
 distinct, as the Philosopher says (Metaph. x, Did. ix, 10). But there
 can be no passing from one genus to another. Therefore if the first
 man was incorruptible, man could not be corruptible in the present
 state.
"," Further, if man were immortal in the state of innocence,
 this would have been due either to nature or to grace. Not to nature,
 for since nature does not change within the same species, he would
 also have been immortal now. Likewise neither would this be owing to
 grace; for the first man recovered grace by repentance, according to
 Wis. 10:2: ""He brought him out of his sins."" Hence he would have
 regained his immortality; which is clearly not the case. Therefore
 man was not immortal in the state of innocence.
"," Further, immortality is promised to man as a reward,
 according to Apoc. 21:4: ""Death shall be no more."" But man was not
 created in the state of reward, but that he might deserve the reward.
 Therefore man was not immortal in the state of innocence.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," These objections are founded on natural
 incorruptibility and immortality.
"," This power of preserving the body was not natural to
 the soul, but was the gift of grace. And though man recovered grace
 as regards remission of guilt and the merit of glory; yet he did not
 recover immortality, the loss of which was an effect of sin; for this
 was reserved for Christ to accomplish, by Whom the defect of nature
 was to be restored into something better, as we shall explain further
 on (III, Q. 14, A. 4, ad 1).
"," The promised reward of the immortality of glory differs
 from the immortality which was bestowed on man in the state of
 innocence.

482,"[I, Q. 97, Art. 2]
","Whether in the State of Innocence Man Would Have Been Passible?
"," It would seem that in the state of innocence man was
 passible. For ""sensation is a kind of passion."" But in the state of
 innocence man would have been sensitive. Therefore he would have been
 passible.
"," Further, sleep is a kind of passion. Now, man slept in the
 state of innocence, according to Gen. 2:21, ""God cast a deep sleep
 upon Adam."" Therefore he would have been passible.
"," Further, the same passage goes on to say that ""He took a rib
 out of Adam."" Therefore he was passible even to the degree of the
 cutting out of part of his body.
"," Further, man's body was soft. But a soft body is naturally
 passible as regards a hard body; therefore if a hard body had come in
 contact with the soft body of the first man, the latter would have
 suffered from the impact. Therefore the first man was passible.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," As already explained (Q. 92, A. 3, ad 2), the rib was
 in Adam as the principle of the human race, as the semen in man, who
 is a principle through generation. Hence as man does not suffer any
 natural deterioration by seminal issue; so neither did he through the
 separation of the rib.
"," Man's body in the state of innocence could be preserved
 from suffering injury from a hard body; partly by the use of his
 reason, whereby he could avoid what was harmful; and partly also by
 Divine Providence, so preserving him, that nothing of a harmful
 nature could come upon him unawares.

483,"[I, Q. 97, Art. 3]
","Whether in the State of Innocence Man Had Need of Food?
"," It would seem that in the state of innocence man did not
 require food. For food is necessary for man to restore what he has
 lost. But Adam's body suffered no loss, as being incorruptible.
 Therefore he had no need of food.
"," Further, food is needed for nourishment. But nourishment
 involves passibility. Since, then, man's body was impassible; it does
 not appear how food could be needful to him.
"," Further, we need food for the preservation of life. But Adam
 could preserve his life otherwise; for had he not sinned, he would
 not have died. Therefore he did not require food.
"," Further, the consumption of food involves voiding of the
 surplus, which seems unsuitable to the state of innocence. Therefore
 it seems that man did not take food in the primitive state.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," As Augustine says (QQ. Vet. et Nov. Test. qu. 19
 [*Works of an anonymous author], among the supposititious works of St.
 Augustine): ""How could man have an immortal body, which was sustained
 by food? Since an immortal being needs neither food nor drink."" For
 we have explained (A. 1) that the immortality of the primitive state
 was based on a supernatural force in the soul, and not on any
 intrinsic disposition of the body: so that by the action of heat, the
 body might lose part of its humid qualities; and to prevent the
 entire consumption of the humor, man was obliged to take food.
"," A certain passion and alteration attends nutriment, on
 the part of the food changed into the substance of the thing
 nourished. So we cannot thence conclude that man's body was passible,
 but that the food taken was passible; although this kind of passion
 conduced to the perfection of the nature.
"," If man had not taken food he would have sinned; as he
 also sinned by taking the forbidden fruit. For he was told at the
 same time, to abstain from the tree of knowledge of good and evil,
 and to eat of every other tree of Paradise.
"," Some say that in the state of innocence man would not
 have taken more than necessary food, so that there would have been
 nothing superfluous; which, however, is unreasonable to suppose, as
 implying that there would have been no faecal matter. Wherefore there
 was need for voiding the surplus, yet so disposed by God as to be
 decorous and suitable to the state.
",,,,,,,,,,,,
484,"[I, Q. 97, Art. 4]
","Whether in the State of Innocence Man Would Have Acquired Immortality
"," It would seem that the tree of life could not be the
 cause of immortality. For nothing can act beyond its own species; as
 an effect does not exceed its cause. But the tree of life was
 corruptible, otherwise it could not be taken as food; since food is
 changed into the substance of the thing nourished. Therefore the tree
 of life could not give incorruptibility or immortality.
"," Further, effects caused by the forces of plants and other
 natural agencies are natural. If therefore the tree of life caused
 immortality, this would have been natural immortality.
"," Further, this would seem to be reduced to the ancient fable,
 that the gods, by eating a certain food, became immortal; which the
 Philosopher ridicules (Metaph. iii, Did. ii, 4).
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
485,"[Q. 98, Art. 1]
","Whether in the State of Innocence Generation Existed?
"," It would seem there would have been no generation in the
 state of innocence. For, as stated in Phys. v, 5, ""corruption is
 contrary to generation."" But contraries affect the same subject: also
 there would have been no corruption in the state of innocence.
 Therefore neither would there have been generation.
"," Further, the object of generation is the preservation in the
 species of that which is corruptible in the individual. Wherefore
 there is no generation in those individual things which last for
 ever. But in the state of innocence man would have lived for ever.
 Therefore in the state of innocence there would have been no
 generation.
"," Further, by generation man is multiplied. But the
 multiplication of masters requires the division of property, to avoid
 confusion of mastership. Therefore, since man was made master of the
 animals, it would have been necessary to make a division of rights
 when the human race increased by generation. This is against the
 natural law, according to which all things are in common, as Isidore
 says (Etym. v, 4). Therefore there would have been no generation in
 the state of innocence.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," In the state of innocence the human body was in itself
 corruptible, but it could be preserved from corruption by the soul.
 Therefore, since generation belongs to things corruptible, man was
 not to be deprived thereof.
"," Although generation in the state of innocence might not
 have been required for the preservation of the species, yet it would
 have been required for the multiplication of the individual.
"," In our present state a division of possessions is
 necessary on account of the multiplicity of masters, inasmuch as
 community of possession is a source of strife, as the Philosopher
 says (Politic. ii, 5). In the state of innocence, however, the will
 of men would have been so ordered that without any danger of strife
 they would have used in common, according to each one's need, those
 things of which they were masters--a state of things to be observed
 even now among many good men.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
486,"[I, Q. 98, Art. 2]
","Whether in the State of Innocence There Would Have Been Generation by
"," It would seem that generation by coition would not have
 existed in the state of innocence. For, as Damascene says (De Fide
 Orth. ii, 11; iv, 25), the first man in the terrestrial Paradise was
 ""like an angel."" But in the future state of the resurrection, when men
 will be like the angels, ""they shall neither marry nor be married,"" as
 is written Matt. 22:30. Therefore neither in paradise would there have
 been generation by coition.
"," Further, our first parents were created at the age of perfect
 development. Therefore, if generation by coition had existed before
 sin, they would have had intercourse while still in paradise: which
 was not the case according to Scripture (Gen. 4:1).
"," Further, in carnal intercourse, more than at any other time,
 man becomes like the beasts, on account of the vehement delight which
 he takes therein; whence contingency is praiseworthy, whereby man
 refrains from such pleasures. But man is compared to beasts by reason
 of sin, according to Ps. 48:13: ""Man, when he was in honor, did not
 understand; he is compared to senseless beasts, and is become like to
 them."" Therefore, before sin, there would have been no such
 intercourse of man and woman.
"," Further, in the state of innocence there would have been no
 corruption. But virginal integrity is corrupted by intercourse.
 Therefore there would have been no such thing in the state of
 innocence.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," In paradise man would have been like an angel in his
 spirituality of mind, yet with an animal life in his body. After the
 resurrection man will be like an angel, spiritualized in soul and
 body. Wherefore there is no parallel.
"," As Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. ix, 4), our first
 parents did not come together in paradise, because on account of sin
 they were ejected from paradise shortly after the creation of the
 woman; or because, having received the general Divine command
 relative to generation, they awaited the special command relative to
 time.
"," Beasts are without reason. In this way man becomes, as
 it were, like them in coition, because he cannot moderate
 concupiscence. In the state of innocence nothing of this kind would
 have happened that was not regulated by reason, not because delight
 of sense was less, as some say (rather indeed would sensible delight
 have been the greater in proportion to the greater purity of nature
 and the greater sensibility of the body), but because the force of
 concupiscence would not have so inordinately thrown itself into such
 pleasure, being curbed by reason, whose place it is not to lessen
 sensual pleasure, but to prevent the force of concupiscence from
 cleaving to it immoderately. By ""immoderately"" I mean going beyond
 the bounds of reason, as a sober person does not take less pleasure
 in food taken in moderation than the glutton, but his concupiscence
 lingers less in such pleasures. This is what Augustine means by the
 words quoted, which do not exclude intensity of pleasure from the
 state of innocence, but ardor of desire and restlessness of the mind.
 Therefore continence would not have been praiseworthy in the state of
 innocence, whereas it is praiseworthy in our present state, not
 because it removes fecundity, but because it excludes inordinate
 desire. In that state fecundity would have been without lust.
"," As Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 26): In that state
 ""intercourse would have been without prejudice to virginal integrity;
 this would have remained intact, as it does in the menses. And just
 as in giving birth the mother was then relieved, not by groans of
 pain, but by the instigations of maturity; so in conceiving, the
 union was one, not of lustful desire, but of deliberate action.""

","Whether in the State of Innocence Children Would Have Had Perfect
"," It would seem that in the state of innocence children
 would have had perfect strength of the body, as to the use of its
 members, immediately after birth. For Augustine says (De Pecc. Merit.
 et Remiss. i, 38): ""This weakness of the body befits their weakness
 of mind."" But in the state of innocence there would have been no
 weakness of mind. Therefore neither would there have been weakness of
 body in infants.
"," Further, some animals at birth have sufficient strength to
 use their members. But man is nobler than other animals. Therefore
 much more is it natural to man to have strength to use his members at
 birth; and thus it appears to be a punishment of sin that he has not
 that strength.
"," Further, inability to secure a proffered pleasure causes
 affliction. But if children had not full strength in the use of their
 limbs, they would often have been unable to procure something
 pleasurable offered to them; and so they would have been afflicted,
 which was not possible before sin. Therefore, in the state of
 innocence, children would not have been deprived of the use of their
 limbs.
"," Further, the weakness of old age seems to correspond to that
 of infancy. But in the state of innocence there would have been no
 weakness of old age. Therefore neither would there have been such
 weakness in infancy.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," Augustine is speaking of the weakness which we observe
 in children even as regards those acts which befit the state of
 infancy; as is clear from his preceding remark that ""even when close
 to the breast, and longing for it, they are more apt to cry than to
 suckle.""
"," The fact that some animals have the use of their limbs
 immediately after birth, is due, not to their superiority, since more
 perfect animals are not so endowed; but to the dryness of the brain,
 and to the operations proper to such animals being imperfect, so that
 a small amount of strength suffices them.
"," Reply Obj. 3 is clear from what we have said above. We may add that
 they would have desired nothing except with an ordinate will; and
 only what was befitting to their state of life.
"," In the state of innocence man would have been born, yet
 not subject to corruption. Therefore in that state there could have
 been certain infantile defects which result from birth; but not
 senile defects leading to corruption.

","Whether, in the Primitive State, Women Would Have Been Born?
"," It would seem that in the primitive state woman would
 not have been born. For the Philosopher says (De Gener. Animal. ii,
 3) that woman is a ""misbegotten male,"" as though she were a product
 outside the purpose of nature. But in that state nothing would have
 been unnatural in human generation. Therefore in that state women
 would not have been born.
"," Further, every agent produces its like, unless prevented by
 insufficient power or ineptness of matter: thus a small fire cannot
 burn green wood. But in generation the active force is in the male.
 Since, therefore, in the state of innocence man's active force was
 not subject to defect, nor was there inept matter on the part of the
 woman, it seems that males would always have been born.
"," Further, in the state of innocence generation is ordered to
 the multiplication of the human race. But the race would have been
 sufficiently multiplied by the first man and woman, from the fact
 that they would have lived for ever. Therefore, in the state of
 innocence, there was no need for women to be born.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Woman is said to be a ""misbegotten male,"" as being a
 product outside the purpose of nature considered in the individual
 case: but not against the purpose of universal nature, as above
 explained (Q. 92, A. 1, ad 2).
"," The generation of woman is not occasioned either by a
 defect of the active force or by inept matter, as the objection
 proposes; but sometimes by an extrinsic accidental cause; thus the
 Philosopher says (De Animal. Histor. vi, 19): ""The northern wind
 favors the generation of males, and the southern wind that of
 females"": sometimes also by some impression in the soul (of the
 parents), which may easily have some effect on the body (of the
 child). Especially was this the case in the state of innocence, when
 the body was more subject to the soul; so that by the mere will of
 the parent the sex of the offspring might be diversified.
"," The offspring would have been begotten to an animal
 life, as to the use of food and generation. Hence it was fitting that
 all should generate, and not only the first parents. From this it
 seems to follow that males and females would have been in equal
 number.

","Whether Men Would Have Been Born in a State of Righteousness?
"," It would seem that in the state of innocence men would
 not have been born in a state of righteousness. For Hugh of St.
 Victor says (De Sacram. i): ""Before sin the first man would have
 begotten children sinless; but not heirs to their father's
 righteousness.""
"," Further, righteousness is effected by grace, as the Apostle
 says (Rom. 5:16, 21). Now grace is not transfused from one to
 another, for thus it would be natural; but is infused by God alone.
 Therefore children would not have been born righteous.
"," Further, righteousness is in the soul. But the soul is not
 transmitted from the parent. Therefore neither would righteousness
 have been transmitted from parents, to the children.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," These words of Hugh are to be understood as referring,
 not to the habit of righteousness, but to the execution of the act
 thereof.
"," Some say that children would have been born, not with
 the righteousness of grace, which is the principle of merit, but with
 original righteousness. But since the root of original righteousness,
 which conferred righteousness on the first man when he was made,
 consists in the supernatural subjection of the reason to God, which
 subjection results from sanctifying grace, as above explained (Q. 95,
 A. 1), we must conclude that if children were born in original
 righteousness, they would also have been born in grace; thus we have
 said above that the first man was created in grace (Q. 95, A. 1).
 This grace, however, would not have been natural, for it would not
 have been transfused by virtue of the semen; but would have been
 conferred on man immediately on his receiving a rational soul. In the
 same way the rational soul, which is not transmitted by the parent,
 is infused by God as soon as the human body is apt to receive it.

","Whether in the State of Innocence Children Would Have Been Born
"," It would seem that in the state of innocence children
 would have been born confirmed in righteousness. For Gregory says
 (Moral. iv) on the words of Job 3:13: ""For now I should have been
 asleep, etc."": ""If no sinful corruption had infected our first parent,
 he would not have begotten 'children of hell'; no children would have
 been born of him but such as were destined to be saved by the
 Redeemer."" Therefore all would have been born confirmed in
 righteousness.
"," Further, Anselm says (Cur Deus Homo i, 18): ""If our first
 parents had lived so as not to yield to temptation, they would have
 been confirmed in grace, so that with their offspring they would have
 been unable to sin any more."" Therefore the children would have been
 born confirmed in righteousness.
"," Further, good is stronger than evil. But by the sin of the
 first man there resulted, in those born of him, the necessity of sin.
 Therefore, if the first man had persevered in righteousness, his
 descendants would have derived from him the necessity of preserving
 righteousness.
"," Further, the angels who remained faithful to God, while the
 others sinned, were at once confirmed in grace, so as to be unable
 henceforth to sin. In like manner, therefore, man would have been
 confirmed in grace if he had persevered. But he would have begotten
 children like himself. Therefore they also would have been born
 confirmed in righteousness.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," If Adam had not sinned, he would not have begotten
 ""children of hell"" in the sense that they would contract from him sin
 which is the cause of hell: yet by sinning of their own free-will
 they could have become ""children of hell."" If, however, they did not
 become ""children of hell"" by falling into sin, this would not have
 been owing to their being confirmed in righteousness, but to Divine
 Providence preserving them free from sin.
"," Anselm does not say this by way of assertion, but only
 as an opinion, which is clear from his mode of expression as follows:
 ""It seems that if they had lived, etc.""
"," This argument is not conclusive, though Anselm seems to
 have been influenced by it, as appears from his words above quoted.
 For the necessity of sin incurred by the descendants would not have
 been such that they could not return to righteousness, which is the
 case only with the damned. Wherefore neither would the parents have
 transmitted to their descendants the necessity of not sinning, which
 is only in the blessed.
"," There is no comparison between man and the angels; for
 man's free-will is changeable, both before and after choice; whereas
 the angel's is not changeable, as we have said above in treating of
 the angels (Q. 64, A. 2).

 begotten children like himself. But Adam was gifted with perfect
 knowledge (Q. 94, A. 3). Therefore children would have been born
 of him with perfect knowledge.
"," Further, ignorance is a result of sin, as Bede says (Cf.
 I-II, Q. 85, A. 3). But ignorance is privation of knowledge.
 Therefore before sin children would have had perfect knowledge as

"," Further, children would have been gifted with righteousness
 from birth. But knowledge is required for righteousness, since it
 directs our actions. Therefore they would also have been gifted with

 of our first parent, so far as he was established as the father and
 instructor of the whole human race. Therefore he begot children like

"," Ignorance is privation of knowledge due at some
 particular time; and this would not have been in children from their

 that time. Hence, no ignorance would have been in them, but only
 nescience in regard to certain matters. Such nescience was even in

","Whether Children Would Have Had Perfect Use of Reason at Birth?
"," It would seem that children would have had perfect use
 of reason at birth. For that children have not perfect use of reason
 in our present state, is due to the soul being weighed down by the
 body; which was not the case in paradise, because, as it is written,
 ""The corruptible body is a load upon the soul"" (Wis. 9:15).
 Therefore, before sin and the corruption which resulted therefrom,
 children would have had the perfect use of reason at birth.
"," Further, some animals at birth have the use of their natural
 powers, as the lamb at once flees from the wolf. Much more,
 therefore, would men in the state of innocence have had perfect use
 of reason at birth.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The corruptible body is a load upon the soul, because
 it hinders the use of reason even in those matters which belong to
 man at all ages.
"," Even other animals have not at birth such a perfect use
 of their natural powers as they have later on. This is clear from the
 fact that birds teach their young to fly; and the like may be
 observed in other animals. Moreover a special impediment exists in
 man from the humidity of the brain, as we have said above (Q. 99, A.
 1).

493,"[I, Q. 102, Art. 1]
","Whether Paradise Is a Corporeal Place?
"," It would seem that paradise is not a corporeal place.
 For Bede [*Strabus, Gloss on Gen. 2:8] says that ""paradise reaches to
 the lunar circle."" But no earthly place answers that description,
 both because it is contrary to the nature of the earth to be raised
 up so high, and because beneath the moon is the region of fire, which
 would consume the earth. Therefore paradise is not a corporeal place.
"," Further, Scripture mentions four rivers as rising in paradise
 (Gen. 2:10). But the rivers there mentioned have visible sources
 elsewhere, as is clear from the Philosopher (Meteor. i). Therefore
 paradise is not a corporeal place.
"," Further, although men have explored the entire habitable
 world, yet none have made mention of the place of paradise. Therefore
 apparently it is not a corporeal place.
"," Further, the tree of life is described as growing in
 paradise. But the tree of life is a spiritual thing, for it is
 written of Wisdom that ""She is a tree of life to them that lay hold
 on her"" (Prov. 3:18). Therefore paradise also is not a corporeal, but
 a spiritual place.
"," Further, if paradise be a corporeal place, the trees also of
 paradise must be corporeal. But it seems they were not; for corporeal
 trees were produced on the third day, while the planting of the trees
 of paradise is recorded after the work of the six days. Therefore
 paradise was not a corporeal place.
",,,,,,,,,,,,," Bede's assertion is untrue, if taken in its obvious
 sense. It may, however, be explained to mean that paradise reaches to
 the moon, not literally, but figuratively; because, as Isidore says
 (Etym. xiv, 3), the atmosphere there is ""a continually even
 temperature""; and in this respect it is like the heavenly bodies,
 which are devoid of opposing elements. Mention, however, is made of
 the moon rather than of other bodies, because, of all the heavenly
 bodies, the moon is nearest to us, and is, moreover, the most akin to
 the earth; hence it is observed to be overshadowed by clouds so as to
 be almost obscured. Others say that paradise reached to the
 moon--that is, to the middle space of the air, where rain, and wind,
 and the like arise; because the moon is said to have influence on
 such changes. But in this sense it would not be a fit place for human
 dwelling, through being uneven in temperature, and not attuned to the
 human temperament, as is the lower atmosphere in the neighborhood of
 the earth.
"," Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. viii, 7): ""It is probable
 that man has no idea where paradise was, and that the rivers, whose
 sources are said to be known, flowed for some distance underground,
 and then sprang up elsewhere. For who is not aware that such is the
 case with some other streams?""
"," The situation of paradise is shut off from the
 habitable world by mountains, or seas, or some torrid region, which
 cannot be crossed; and so people who have written about topography
 make no mention of it.
"," The tree of life is a material tree, and so called
 because its fruit was endowed with a life-preserving power as above
 stated (Q. 97, A. 4). Yet it had a spiritual signification; as the
 rock in the desert was of a material nature, and yet signified
 Christ. In like manner the tree of the knowledge of good and evil was
 a material tree, so called in view of future events; because, after
 eating of it, man was to learn, by experience of the consequent
 punishment, the difference between the good of obedience and the evil
 of rebellion. It may also be said to signify spiritually the
 free-will as some say.
"," According to Augustine (Gen. ad lit. v, 5, viii, 3),
 the plants were not actually produced on the third day, but in their
 seminal virtues; whereas, after the work of the six days, the plants,
 both of paradise and others, were actually produced. According to
 other holy writers, we ought to say that all the plants were actually
 produced on the third day, including the trees of paradise; and what
 is said of the trees of paradise being planted after the work of the
 six days is to be understood, they say, by way of recapitulation.
 Whence our text reads: ""The Lord God had planted a paradise of
 pleasure from the beginning"" (Gen. 2:8).
",,,,,,,,,,,
494,"[I, Q. 102, Art. 2]
","Whether Paradise Was a Place Adapted to Be the Abode of Man?
"," It would seem that paradise was not a place adapted to
 be the abode of man. For man and angels are similarly ordered to
 beatitude. But the angels from the very beginning of their existence
 were made to dwell in the abode of the blessed--that is, the empyrean
 heaven. Therefore the place of man's habitation should have been
 there also.
"," Further, if some definite place were required for man's
 abode, this would be required on the part either of the soul or of
 the body. If on the part of the soul, the place would be in heaven,
 which is adapted to the nature of the soul; since the desire of
 heaven is implanted in all. On the part of the body, there was no
 need for any other place than the one provided for other animals.
 Therefore paradise was not at all adapted to be the abode of man.
"," Further, a place which contains nothing is useless. But after
 sin, paradise was not occupied by man. Therefore if it were adapted
 as a dwelling-place for man, it seems that God made paradise to no
 purpose.
"," Further, since man is of an even temperament, a fitting place
 for him should be of even temperature. But paradise was not of an
 even temperature; for it is said to have been on the equator--a
 situation of extreme heat, since twice in the year the sun passes
 vertically over the heads of its inhabitants. Therefore paradise was
 not a fit dwelling-place for man.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," The empyrean heaven is the highest of corporeal places,
 and is outside the region of change. By the first of these two
 conditions, it is a fitting abode for the angelic nature: for, as
 Augustine says (De Trin. ii), ""God rules corporeal creatures through
 spiritual creatures."" Hence it is fitting that the spiritual nature
 should be established above the entire corporeal nature, as presiding
 over it. By the second condition, it is a fitting abode for the state
 of beatitude, which is endowed with the highest degree of stability.
 Thus the abode of beatitude was suited to the very nature of the
 angel; therefore he was created there. But it is not suited to man's
 nature, since man is not set as a ruler over the entire corporeal
 creation: it is a fitting abode for man in regard only to his
 beatitude. Wherefore he was not placed from the beginning in the
 empyrean heaven, but was destined to be transferred thither in the
 state of his final beatitude.
"," It is ridiculous to assert that any particular place
 is natural to the soul or to any spiritual substances, though some
 particular place may have a certain fitness in regard to spiritual
 substances. For the earthly paradise was a place adapted to man, as
 regards both his body and his soul--that is, inasmuch as in his soul
 was the force which preserved the human body from corruption. This
 could not be said of the other animals. Therefore, as Damascene says
 (De Fide Orth. ii, 11): ""No irrational animal inhabited paradise"";
 although, by a certain dispensation, the animals were brought thither
 by God to Adam; and the serpent was able to trespass therein by the
 complicity of the devil.
"," Paradise did not become useless through being
 unoccupied by man after sin, just as immortality was not conferred
 on man in vain, though he was to lose it. For thereby we learn God's
 kindness to man, and what man lost by sin. Moreover, some say that
 Enoch and Elias still dwell in that paradise.
"," Those who say that paradise was on the equinoctial line
 are of opinion that such a situation is most temperate, on account of
 the unvarying equality of day and night; that it is never too cold
 there, because the sun is never too far off; and never too hot,
 because, although the sun passes over the heads of the inhabitants,
 it does not remain long in that position. However, Aristotle
 distinctly says (Meteor. ii, 5) that such a region is uninhabitable
 on account of the heat. This seems to be more probable; because, even
 those regions where the sun does not pass vertically overhead, are
 extremely hot on account of the mere proximity of the sun. But
 whatever be the truth of the matter, we must hold that paradise was
 situated in a most temperate situation, whether on the equator or
 elsewhere.

","Whether Man Was Placed in Paradise to Dress It and Keep It?
"," It would seem that man was not placed in paradise to
 dress and keep it. For what was brought on him as a punishment of sin
 would not have existed in paradise in the state of innocence. But the
 cultivation of the soil was a punishment of sin (Gen. 3:17).
 Therefore man was not placed in paradise to dress and keep it.
"," Further, there is no need of a keeper when there is no fear
 of trespass with violence. But in paradise there was no fear of
 trespass with violence. Therefore there was no need for man to keep
 paradise.
"," Further, if man was placed in paradise to dress and keep it,
 man would apparently have been made for the sake of paradise, and not
 contrariwise; which seems to be false. Therefore man was not place in
 paradise to dress and keep it.

 But before sin paradise was a fitting abode for man. Therefore it
 seems that man was created in paradise.
"," Further, other animals remain in the place where they are
 produced, as the fish in the water, and walking animals on the earth
 from which they were made. Now man would have remained in paradise
 after he was created (Q. 97, A. 4). Therefore he was created in
 paradise.

497,"[I, Q. 103, Art. 1]
","Whether the World Is Governed by Anyone?
"," It would seem that the world is not governed by anyone.
 For it belongs to those things to be governed, which move or work for
 an end. But natural things which make up the greater part of the world
 do not move, or work for an end; for they have no knowledge of their
 end. Therefore the world is not governed.
"," Further, those things are governed which are moved towards
 an object. But the world does not appear to be so directed, but has
 stability in itself. Therefore it is not governed.
"," Further, what is necessarily determined by its own nature
 to one particular thing, does not require any external principle of
 government. But the principal parts of the world are by a certain
 necessity determined to something particular in their actions and
 movements. Therefore the world does not require to be governed.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," A thing moves or operates for an end in two
 ways. First, in moving itself to the end, as man and other rational
 creatures; and such things have knowledge of their end, and of the
 means to the end. Secondly, a thing is said to move or operate for an
 end, as though moved or directed by another thereto, as an arrow
 directed to the target by the archer, who knows the end unknown to the
 arrow. Wherefore, as the movement of the arrow towards a definite end
 shows clearly that it is directed by someone with knowledge, so the
 unvarying course of natural things which are without knowledge, shows
 clearly that the world is governed by some reason.
"," In all created things there is a stable element,
 at least primary matter; and something belonging to movement, if under
 movement we include operation. And things need governing as to both:
 because even that which is stable, since it is created from nothing,
 would return to nothingness were it not sustained by a governing hand,
 as will be explained later (Q. 104, A. 1).
"," The natural necessity inherent in those beings
 which are determined to a particular thing, is a kind of impression
 from God, directing them to their end; as the necessity whereby an
 arrow is moved so as to fly towards a certain point is an impression
 from the archer, and not from the arrow. But there is a difference,
 inasmuch as that which creatures receive from God is their nature,
 while that which natural things receive from man in addition to their
 nature is somewhat violent. Wherefore, as the violent necessity in the
 movement of the arrow shows the action of the archer, so the natural
 necessity of things shows the government of Divine Providence.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
498,"[I, Q. 103, Art. 2]
","Whether the End of the Government of the World Is Something Outside
"," It would seem that the end of the government of the
 world is not something existing outside the world. For the end of the
 government of a thing is that whereto the thing governed is brought.
 But that whereto a thing is brought is some good in the thing itself;
 thus a sick man is brought back to health, which is something good in
 him. Therefore the end of government of things is some good not
 outside, but within the things themselves.
"," Further, the Philosopher says (Ethic. i, 1): ""Some ends are
 an operation; some are a work""--i.e. produced by an operation. But
 nothing can be produced by the whole universe outside itself; and
 operation exists in the agent. Therefore nothing extrinsic can be the
 end of the government of things.
"," Further, the good of the multitude seems to consist in order,
 and peace which is the ""tranquillity of order,"" as Augustine says (De
 Civ. Dei xix, 13). But the world is composed of a multitude of
 things. Therefore the end of the government of the world is the
 peaceful order in things themselves. Therefore the end of the
 government of the world is not an extrinsic good.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," We may acquire some good in many ways: first, as a form
 existing in us, such as health or knowledge; secondly, as something
 done by us, as a builder attains his end by building a house;
 thirdly, as something good possessed or acquired by us, as the buyer
 of a field attains his end when he enters into possession. Wherefore
 nothing prevents something outside the universe being the good to
 which it is directed.
"," The Philosopher is speaking of the ends of various
 arts; for the end of some arts consists in the operation itself, as
 the end of a harpist is to play the harp; whereas the end of other
 arts consists in something produced, as the end of a builder is not
 the act of building, but the house he builds. Now it may happen that
 something extrinsic is the end not only as made, but also as
 possessed or acquired or even as represented, as if we were to say
 that Hercules is the end of the statue made to represent him.
 Therefore we may say that some good outside the whole universe is the
 end of the government of the universe, as something possessed and
 represented; for each thing tends to a participation thereof, and to
 an assimilation thereto, as far as is possible.
"," A good existing in the universe, namely, the order of
 the universe, is an end thereof; this, however, is not its ultimate
 end, but is ordered to the extrinsic good as to the end: thus the
 order in an army is ordered to the general, as stated in Metaph.

","Whether the World Is Governed by One?
"," It would seem that the world is not governed by one. For
 we judge the cause by the effect. Now, we see in the government of the
 universe that things are not moved and do not operate uniformly, but
 some contingently and some of necessity in variously different ways.
 Therefore the world is not governed by one.
"," Further, things which are governed by one do not act against
 each other, except by the incapacity or unskillfulness of the ruler;
 which cannot apply to God. But created things agree not together, and
 act against each other; as is evident in the case of contraries.
 Therefore the world is not governed by one.

 ""is better that two should be together than one"" (Eccles. 4:9).
 Therefore the world is not governed by one, but by many.

 governors.

 that which is caused in the things governed. This is one, namely, the
 good which consists in order; as may be seen in the example of an
 army. Therefore the government of the world has but one effect.
"," Further, from one there naturally proceeds but one. But the
 world is governed by one as we have proved (A. 3). Therefore also the
 effect of this government is but one.
"," Further, if the effect of government is not one by reason of
 the unity of the Governor, it must be many by reason of the many
 things governed. But these are too numerous to be counted. Therefore
 we cannot assign any definite number to the effects of government.

","Whether All Things Are Subject to the Divine Government?
"," It would seem that not all things are subject to the
 Divine government. For it is written (Eccles. 9:11): ""I saw that
 under the sun the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the
 strong, nor bread to the wise, nor riches to the learned, nor favor
 to the skillful, but time and chance in all."" But things subject to
 the Divine government are not ruled by chance. Therefore those things
 which are under the sun are not subject to the Divine government.
"," Further, the Apostle says (1 Cor. 9:9): ""God hath no care
 for oxen."" But he that governs has care for the things he governs.
 Therefore all things are not subject to the Divine government.
"," Further, what can govern itself needs not to be governed by
 another. But the rational creature can govern itself; since it is
 master of its own act, and acts of itself; and is not made to act by
 another, which seems proper to things which are governed. Therefore
 all things are not subject to the Divine government.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," These things are said to be under the sun which are
 generated and corrupted according to the sun's movement. In all such
 things we find chance: not that everything is casual which occurs in
 such things; but that in each one there is an element of chance. And
 the very fact that an element of chance is found in those things
 proves that they are subject to government of some kind. For unless
 corruptible things were governed by a higher being, they would tend
 to nothing definite, especially those which possess no kind of
 knowledge. So nothing would happen unintentionally; which constitutes
 the nature of chance. Wherefore to show how things happen by chance
 and yet according to the ordering of a higher cause, he does not say
 absolutely that he observes chance in all things, but ""time and
 chance,"" that is to say, that defects may be found in these things
 according to some order of time.
"," Government implies a certain change effected by the
 governor in the things governed. Now every movement is the act of a
 movable thing, caused by the moving principle, as is laid down
 Phys. iii, 3. And every act is proportionate to that of which it is
 an act. Consequently, various movable things must be moved variously,
 even as regards movement by one and the same mover. Thus by the one
 art of the Divine governor, various things are variously governed
 according to their variety. Some, according to their nature, act of
 themselves, having dominion over their actions; and these are
 governed by God, not only in this, that they are moved by God
 Himself, Who works in them interiorly; but also in this, that they
 are induced by Him to do good and to fly from evil, by precepts and
 prohibitions, rewards and punishments. But irrational creatures which
 do not act but are acted upon, are not thus governed by God. Hence,
 when the Apostle says that ""God hath no care for oxen,"" he does not
 wholly withdraw them from the Divine government, but only as regards
 the way in which rational creatures are governed.
"," The rational creature governs itself by its intellect
 and will, both of which require to be governed and perfected by the
 Divine intellect and will. Therefore above the government whereby
 the rational creature governs itself as master of its own act, it
 requires to be governed by God.

","Whether all things are immediately governed by God?
"," It would seem that all things are governed by God
 immediately. For Gregory of Nyssa (Nemesius, De Nat. Hom.) reproves
 the opinion of Plato who divides providence into three parts. The
 first he ascribes to the supreme god, who watches over heavenly
 things and all universals; the second providence he attributes to
 the secondary deities, who go the round of the heavens to watch over
 generation and corruption; while he ascribes a third providence to
 certain spirits who are guardians on earth of human actions.
 Therefore it seems that all things are immediately governed by God.
"," Further, it is better that a thing be done by one, if
 possible, than by many, as the Philosopher says (Phys. viii, 6). But
 God can by Himself govern all things without any intermediary cause.
 Therefore it seems that He governs all things immediately.
"," Further, in God nothing is defective or imperfect. But it
 seems to be imperfect in a ruler to govern by means of others; thus
 an earthly king, by reason of his not being able to do everything
 himself, and because he cannot be everywhere at the same time,
 requires to govern by means of ministers. Therefore God governs all
 things immediately.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Plato's opinion is to be rejected, because he held that
 God did not govern all things immediately, even in the design of
 government; this is clear from the fact that he divided providence,
 which is the design of government, into three parts.
"," If God governed alone, things would be deprived of the
 perfection of causality. Wherefore all that is effected by many would
 not be accomplished by one.
"," That an earthly king should have ministers to execute
 his laws is a sign not only of his being imperfect, but also of his
 dignity; because by the ordering of ministers the kingly power is
 brought into greater evidence.

","Whether Anything Can Happen Outside the Order of the Divine
"," It would seem possible that something may occur outside
 the order of the Divine government. For Boethius says (De Consol.
 iii) that ""God disposes all for good."" Therefore, if nothing happens
 outside the order of the Divine government, it would follow that no
 evil exists.
"," Further, nothing that is in accordance with the
 pre-ordination of a ruler occurs by chance. Therefore, if nothing
 occurs outside the order of the Divine government, it follows that
 there is nothing fortuitous and casual.
"," Further, the order of Divine Providence is certain and
 unchangeable; because it is in accordance with the eternal design.
 Therefore, if nothing happens outside the order of the Divine
 government, it follows that all things happen by necessity, and
 nothing is contingent; which is false. Therefore it is possible for
 something to occur outside the order of the Divine government.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," There is nothing wholly evil in the world, for evil is
 ever founded on good, as shown above (Q. 48, A. 3). Therefore
 something is said to be evil through its escaping from the order of
 some particular good. If it wholly escaped from the order of the
 Divine government, it would wholly cease to exist.
"," Things are said to be fortuitous as regards some
 particular cause from the order of which they escape. But as to the
 order of Divine providence, ""nothing in the world happens by chance,""
 as Augustine declares (QQ. 83, qu. 24).
"," Certain effects are said to be contingent as compared
 to their proximate causes, which may fail in their effects; and not

","Whether Creatures Need to Be Kept in Being by God?
"," It would seem that creatures do not need to be kept in
 being by God. For what cannot not-be, does not need to be kept in
 being; just as that which cannot depart, does not need to be kept
 from departing. But some creatures by their very nature cannot
 not-be. Therefore not all creatures need to be kept in being by God.
 The middle proposition is proved thus. That which is included in the
 nature of a thing is necessarily in that thing, and its contrary
 cannot be in it; thus a multiple of two must necessarily be even, and
 cannot possibly be an odd number. Now form brings being with itself,
 because everything is actually in being, so far as it has form. But
 some creatures are subsistent forms, as we have said of the angels
 (Q. 50, AA. 2, 5): and thus to be is in them of themselves. The same
 reasoning applies to those creatures whose matter is in potentiality
 to one form only, as above explained of heavenly bodies (Q. 66, A.
 2). Therefore such creatures as these have in their nature to be
 necessarily, and cannot not-be; for there can be no potentiality to
 not-being, either in the form which has being of itself, or in matter
 existing under a form which it cannot lose, since it is not in
 potentiality to any other form.
"," Further, God is more powerful than any created agent. But a
 created agent, even after ceasing to act, can cause its effect to be
 preserved in being; thus the house continues to stand after the
 builder has ceased to build; and water remains hot for some time
 after the fire has ceased to heat. Much more, therefore, can God
 cause His creature to be kept in being, after He has ceased to create
 it.
"," Further, nothing violent can occur, except there be some
 active cause thereof. But tendency to not-being is unnatural and
 violent to any creature, since all creatures naturally desire to be.
 Therefore no creature can tend to not-being, except through some
 active cause of corruption. Now there are creatures of such a nature
 that nothing can cause them to corrupt; such are spiritual substances
 and heavenly bodies. Therefore such creatures cannot tend to
 not-being, even if God were to withdraw His action.
"," Further, if God keeps creatures in being, this is done by
 some action. Now every action of an agent, if that action be
 efficacious, produces something in the effect. Therefore the
 preserving power of God must produce something in the creature. But
 this is not so; because this action does not give being to the
 creature, since being is not given to that which already is: nor does
 it add anything new to the creature; because either God would not
 keep the creature in being continually, or He would be continually
 adding something new to the creature; either of which is
 unreasonable. Therefore creatures are not kept in being by God.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," Being naturally results from the form of a creature,
 given the influence of the Divine action; just as light results from
 the diaphanous nature of the air, given the action of the sun.
 Wherefore the potentiality to not-being in spiritual creatures and
 heavenly bodies is rather something in God, Who can withdraw His
 influence, than in the form or matter of those creatures.
"," God cannot grant to a creature to be preserved in being
 after the cessation of the Divine influence: as neither can He make
 it not to have received its being from Himself. For the creature
 needs to be preserved by God in so far as the being of an effect
 depends on the cause of its being. So that there is no comparison
 with an agent that is not the cause of being but only of becoming.
"," This argument holds in regard to that preservation
 which consists in the removal of corruption: but all creatures do not
 need to be preserved thus, as stated above.
"," The preservation of things by God is a continuation of
 that action whereby He gives existence, which action is without
 either motion or time; so also the preservation of light in the air
 is by the continual influence of the sun.

506,"[I, Q. 104, Art. 2]
","Whether God Preserves Every Creature Immediately?
"," It would seem that God preserves every creature
 immediately. For God creates and preserves things by the same action,
 as above stated (A. 1, ad 4). But God created all things immediately.
 Therefore He preserves all things immediately.
"," Further, a thing is nearer to itself than to another. But it
 cannot be given to a creature to preserve itself; much less therefore
 can it be given to a creature to preserve another. Therefore God
 preserves all things without any intermediate cause preserving them.
"," Further, an effect is kept in being by the cause, not only of
 its becoming, but also of its being. But all created causes do not
 seem to cause their effects except in their becoming, for they
 cause only by moving, as above stated (Q. 45, A. 3). Therefore they
 do not cause so as to keep their effects in being.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," God created all things immediately, but in the
 creation itself He established an order among things, so that some
 depend on others, by which they are preserved in being, though He
 remains the principal cause of their preservation.
"," Since an effect is preserved by its proper cause
 on which it depends; just as no effect can be its own cause, but can
 only produce another effect, so no effect can be endowed with the
 power of self-preservation, but only with the power of preserving
 another.
"," No created nature can be the cause of another,
 as regards the latter acquiring a new form, or disposition, except by
 virtue of some change; for the created nature acts always on something
 presupposed. But after causing the form or disposition in the effect,
 without any fresh change in the effect, the cause preserves that form
 or disposition; as in the air, when it is lit up anew, we must allow
 some change to have taken place, while the preservation of the light
 is without any further change in the air due to the presence of the
 source of light.

507,"[I, Q. 104, Art. 3]
","Whether God Can Annihilate Anything?
"," It would seem that God cannot annihilate anything. For
 Augustine says (QQ. 83, qu. 21) that ""God is not the cause of anything
 tending to non-existence."" But He would be such a cause if He were to
 annihilate anything. Therefore He cannot annihilate anything.
"," Further, by His goodness God is the cause why things exist,
 since, as Augustine says (De Doctr. Christ. i, 32): ""Because God is
 good, we exist."" But God cannot cease to be good. Therefore He cannot
 cause things to cease to exist; which would be the case were He to
 annihilate anything.
"," Further, if God were to annihilate anything it would be by
 His action. But this cannot be; because the term of every action is
 existence. Hence even the action of a corrupting cause has its term
 in something generated; for when one thing is generated another
 undergoes corruption. Therefore God cannot annihilate anything.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Non-existence has no direct cause; for nothing is a
 cause except inasmuch as it has existence, and a being essentially as
 such is a cause of something existing. Therefore God cannot cause a
 thing to tend to non-existence, whereas a creature has this tendency
 of itself, since it is produced from nothing. But indirectly God can
 be the cause of things being reduced to non-existence, by withdrawing
 His action therefrom.
"," God's goodness is the cause of things, not as though by
 natural necessity, because the Divine goodness does not depend on
 creatures; but by His free-will. Wherefore, as without prejudice to
 His goodness, He might not have produced things into existence, so,
 without prejudice to His goodness, He might not preserve things in
 existence.
"," If God were to annihilate anything, this would not
 imply an action on God's part; but a mere cessation of His action.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
508,"[I, Q. 104, Art. 4]
","Whether Anything Is Annihilated?
"," It would seem that something is annihilated. For the end
 corresponds to the beginning. But in the beginning there was nothing
 but God. Therefore all things must tend to this end, that there shall
 be nothing but God. Therefore creatures will be reduced to nothing.
"," Further, every creature has a finite power. But no finite
 power extends to the infinite. Wherefore the Philosopher proves (Phys.
 viii, 10) that, ""a finite power cannot move in infinite time.""
 Therefore a creature cannot last for an infinite duration; and so at
 some time it will be reduced to nothing.
"," Further, forms and accidents have no matter as part of
 themselves. But at some time they cease to exist. Therefore they are
 reduced to nothing.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," That things are brought into existence from a state of
 non-existence, clearly shows the power of Him Who made them; but that
 they should be reduced to nothing would hinder that manifestation,
 since the power of God is conspicuously shown in His preserving all
 things in existence, according to the Apostle: ""Upholding all things
 by the word of His power"" (Heb. 1:3).
"," A creature's potentiality to existence is merely
 receptive; the active power belongs to God Himself, from Whom
 existence is derived. Wherefore the infinite duration of things is a
 consequence of the infinity of the Divine power. To some things,
 however, is given a determinate power of duration for a certain time,
 so far as they may be hindered by some contrary agent from receiving
 the influx of existence which comes from Him Whom finite power cannot
 resist, for an infinite, but only for a fixed time. So things which
 have no contrary, although they have a finite power, continue to
 exist for ever.
"," Forms and accidents are not complete beings, since they
 do not subsist: but each one of them is something ""of a being""; for
 it is called a being, because something is by it. Yet so far as their
 mode of existence is concerned, they are not entirely reduced to
 nothingness; not that any part of them survives, but that they remain
 in the potentiality of the matter, or of the subject.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
509,"[I, Q. 105, Art. 1]
","Whether God Can Move the Matter Immediately to the Form?
"," It would seem that God cannot move the matter immediately
 to receive the form. For as the Philosopher proves (Metaph. vii, Did.
 vi, 8), nothing can bring a form into any particular matter, except
 that form which is in matter; because, like begets like. But God is
 not a form in matter. Therefore He cannot cause a form in matter.
"," Further, any agent inclined to several effects will produce
 none of them, unless it is determined to a particular one by some
 other cause; for, as the Philosopher says (De Anima iii, 11), a
 general assertion does not move the mind, except by means of some
 particular apprehension. But the Divine power is the universal cause
 of all things. Therefore it cannot produce any particular form,
 except by means of a particular agent.
"," As universal being depends on the first universal cause, so
 determinate being depends on determinate particular causes; as we
 have seen above (Q. 104, A. 2). But the determinate being of a
 particular thing is from its own form. Therefore the forms of things
 are produced by God, only by means of particular causes.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," An effect is assimilated to the active cause in two
 ways. First, according to the same species; as man is generated by
 man, and fire by fire. Secondly, by being virtually contained in the
 cause; as the form of the effect is virtually contained in its cause:
 thus animals produced by putrefaction, and plants, and minerals are
 like the sun and stars, by whose power they are produced. In this way
 the effect is like its active cause as regards all that over which
 the power of that cause extends. Now the power of God extends to both
 matter and form; as we have said above (Q. 14, A. 2; Q. 44, A. 2);
 wherefore if a composite thing be produced, it is likened to God by
 way of a virtual inclusion; or it is likened to the composite
 generator by a likeness of species. Therefore just as the composite
 generator can move matter to a form by generating a composite thing
 like itself; so also can God. But no other form not existing in
 matter can do this; because the power of no other separate substance
 extends over matter. Hence angels and demons operate on visible
 matter; not by imprinting forms in matter, but by making use of
 corporeal seeds.
"," This argument would hold if God were to act of natural
 necessity. But since He acts by His will and intellect, which knows
 the particular and not only the universal natures of all forms, it
 follows that He can determinately imprint this or that form on matter.
"," The fact that secondary causes are ordered to
 determinate effects is due to God; wherefore since God ordains other
 causes to certain effects He can also produce certain effects by
 Himself without any other cause.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
510,"[I, Q. 105, Art. 2]
","Whether God Can Move a Body Immediately?
"," It would seem that God cannot move a body immediately.
 For as the mover and the moved must exist simultaneously, as the
 Philosopher says (Phys. vii, 2), it follows that there must be some
 contact between the mover and moved. But there can be no contact
 between God and a body; for Dionysius says (Div. Nom. 1): ""There is
 no contact with God."" Therefore God cannot move a body immediately.
"," Further, God is the mover unmoved. But such also is the
 desirable object when apprehended. Therefore God moves as the object
 of desire and apprehension. But He cannot be apprehended except by the
 intellect, which is neither a body nor a corporeal power. Therefore
 God cannot move a body immediately.
"," Further, the Philosopher proves (Phys. viii, 10) that an
 infinite power moves instantaneously. But it is impossible for a body
 to be moved in one instant; for since every movement is between
 opposites, it follows that two opposites would exist at once in the
 same subject, which is impossible. Therefore a body cannot be moved
 immediately by an infinite power. But God's power is infinite, as we
 have explained (Q. 25, A. 2). Therefore God cannot move a body
 immediately.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," There are two kinds of contact; corporeal contact, when
 two bodies touch each other; and virtual contact, as the cause of
 sadness is said to touch the one made sad. According to the first
 kind of contact, God, as being incorporeal, neither touches, nor is
 touched; but according to virtual contact He touches creatures by
 moving them; but He is not touched, because the natural power of no
 creature can reach up to Him. Thus did Dionysius understand the
 words, ""There is no contact with God""; that is, so that God Himself
 be touched.
"," God moves as the object of desire and apprehension; but
 it does not follow that He always moves as being desired and
 apprehended by that which is moved; but as being desired and known by
 Himself; for He does all things for His own goodness.
"," The Philosopher (Phys. viii, 10) intends to
 prove that the power of the first mover is not a power of the first
 mover of bulk, by the following argument. The power of the first
 mover is infinite (which he proves from the fact that the first mover
 can move in infinite time). Now an infinite power, if it were a power
 of bulk, would move without time, which is impossible; therefore the
 infinite power of the first mover must be in something which is not
 measured by its bulk. Whence it is clear that for a body to be moved
 without time can only be the result of an infinite power. The reason
 is that every power of bulk moves in its entirety; since it moves by
 the necessity of its nature. But an infinite power surpasses out of
 all proportion any finite power. Now the greater the power of the
 mover, the greater is the velocity of the movement. Therefore, since a
 finite power moves in a determinate time, it follows that an infinite
 power does not move in any time; for between one time and any other
 time there is some proportion. On the other hand, a power which is not
 in bulk is the power of an intelligent being, which operates in its
 effects according to what is fitting to them; and therefore, since it
 cannot be fitting for a body to be moved without time, it does not
 follow that it moves without time.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
511,"[I, Q. 105, Art. 3]
","Whether God Moves the Created Intellect Immediately?
"," It would seem that God does not immediately move the
 created intellect. For the action of the intellect is governed by its
 own subject; since it does not pass into external matter; as stated
 in Metaph. ix, Did. viii, 8. But the action of what is moved by
 another does not proceed from that wherein it is; but from the mover.
 Therefore the intellect is not moved by another; and so apparently
 God cannot move the created intellect.
"," Further, anything which in itself is a sufficient principle
 of movement, is not moved by another. But the movement of the
 intellect is its act of understanding; in the sense in which we say
 that to understand or to feel is a kind of movement, as the
 Philosopher says (De Anima iii, 7). But the intellectual light which
 is natural to the soul, is a sufficient principle of understanding.
 Therefore it is not moved by another.
"," Further, as the senses are moved by the sensible, so the
 intellect is moved by the intelligible. But God is not intelligible
 to us, and exceeds the capacity of our intellect. Therefore God
 cannot move our intellect.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The intellectual operation is performed by the
 intellect in which it exists, as by a secondary cause; but it proceeds
 from God as from its first cause. For by Him the power to understand
 is given to the one who understands.
"," The intellectual light together with the likeness of
 the thing understood is a sufficient principle of understanding; but
 it is a secondary principle, and depends upon the First Principle.
"," The intelligible object moves our human intellect, so
 far as, in a way, it impresses on it its own likeness, by means of
 which the intellect is able to understand it. But the likenesses
 which God impresses on the created intellect are not sufficient to
 enable the created intellect to understand Him through His Essence,
 as we have seen above (Q. 12, A. 2; Q. 56, A. 3). Hence He moves the
 created intellect, and yet He cannot be intelligible to it, as we
 have explained (Q. 12, A. 4).

512,"[I, Q. 105, Art. 4]
","Whether God Can Move the Created Will?
"," It would seem that God cannot move the created will. For
 whatever is moved from without, is forced. But the will cannot be
 forced. Therefore it is not moved from without; and therefore cannot
 be moved by God.
"," Further, God cannot make two contradictories to be true at
 the same time. But this would follow if He moved the will; for to be
 voluntarily moved means to be moved from within, and not by another.
 Therefore God cannot move the will.
"," Further, movement is attributed to the mover rather than to
 the one moved; wherefore homicide is not ascribed to the stone, but
 to the thrower. Therefore, if God moves the will, it follows that
 voluntary actions are not imputed to man for reward or blame. But
 this is false. Therefore God does not move the will.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," A thing moved by another is forced if moved against its
 natural inclination; but if it is moved by another giving to it the
 proper natural inclination, it is not forced; as when a heavy body is
 made to move downwards by that which produced it, then it is not
 forced. In like manner God, while moving the will, does not force it,
 because He gives the will its own natural inclination.
"," To be moved voluntarily, is to be moved from within,
 that is, by an interior principle: yet this interior principle may be
 caused by an exterior principle; and so to be moved from within is
 not repugnant to being moved by another.
"," If the will were so moved by another as in no way to be
 moved from within itself, the act of the will would not be imputed
 for reward or blame. But since its being moved by another does not
 prevent its being moved from within itself, as we have stated (ad 2),
 it does not thereby forfeit the motive for merit or demerit.

","Whether God Works in Every Agent?
"," It would seem that God does not work in every agent. For
 we must not attribute any insufficiency to God. If therefore God works
 in every agent, He works sufficiently in each one. Hence it would be
 superfluous for the created agent to work at all.
"," Further, the same work cannot proceed at the same time from
 two sources; as neither can one and the same movement belong to two
 movable things. Therefore if the creature's operation is from God
 operating in the creature, it cannot at the same time proceed from
 the creature; and so no creature works at all.
"," Further, the maker is the cause of the operation of the thing
 made, as giving it the form whereby it operates. Therefore, if God is
 the cause of the operation of things made by Him, this would be
 inasmuch as He gives them the power of operating. But this is in the
 beginning, when He makes them. Thus it seems that God does not
 operate any further in the operating creature.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," God works sufficiently in things as First Agent, but it
 does not follow from this that the operation of secondary agents is
 superfluous.
"," One action does not proceed from two agents of the same
 order. But nothing hinders the same action from proceeding from a
 primary and a secondary agent.
"," God not only gives things their form, but He also
 preserves them in existence, and applies them to act, and is moreover
 the end of every action, as above explained.

514,"[I, Q. 105, Art. 6]
","Whether God Can Do Anything Outside the Established Order of Nature?
"," It would seem that God cannot do anything outside the
 established order of nature. For Augustine (Contra Faust. xxvi, 3)
 says: ""God the Maker and Creator of each nature, does nothing against
 nature."" But that which is outside the natural order seems to be
 against nature. Therefore God can do nothing outside the natural
 order.
"," Further, as the order of justice is from God, so is the order
 of nature. But God cannot do anything outside the order of justice;
 for then He would do something unjust. Therefore He cannot do
 anything outside the order of nature.
"," Further, God established the order of nature. Therefore it
 God does anything outside the order of nature, it would seem that He
 is changeable; which cannot be said.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," In natural things something may happen outside this
 natural order, in two ways. It may happen by the action of an agent
 which did not give them their natural inclination; as, for example,
 when a man moves a heavy body upwards, which does not owe to him its
 natural inclination to move downwards; and that would be against
 nature. It may also happen by the action of the agent on whom the
 natural inclination depends; and this is not against nature, as is
 clear in the ebb and flow of the tide, which is not against nature;
 although it is against the natural movement of water in a downward
 direction; for it is owing to the influence of a heavenly body, on
 which the natural inclination of lower bodies depends. Therefore
 since the order of nature is given to things by God; if He does
 anything outside this order, it is not against nature. Wherefore
 Augustine says (Contra Faust. xxvi, 3): ""That is natural to each
 thing which is caused by Him from Whom is all mode, number, and
 order in nature.""
"," The order of justice arises by relation to the First
 Cause, Who is the rule of all justice; and therefore God can do
 nothing against such order.
"," God fixed a certain order in things in such a way that
 at the same time He reserved to Himself whatever he intended to do
 otherwise than by a particular cause. So when He acts outside this
 order, He does not change.

","Whether Whatever God Does Outside the Natural Order Is Miraculous?
"," It would seem that not everything which God does outside
 the natural order of things, is miraculous. For the creation of the
 world, and of souls, and the justification of the unrighteous, are
 done by God outside the natural order; as not being accomplished by
 the action of any natural cause. Yet these things are not called
 miracles. Therefore not everything that God does outside the natural
 order is a miracle.
"," Further, a miracle is ""something difficult, which seldom
 occurs, surpassing the faculty of nature, and going so far beyond our
 hopes as to compel our astonishment"" [*St. Augustine, De utilitate
 credendi xvi.]. But some things outside the order of nature are not
 arduous; for they occur in small things, such as the recovery and
 healing of the sick. Nor are they of rare occurrence, since they
 happen frequently; as when the sick were placed in the streets, to be
 healed by the shadow of Peter (Acts 5:15). Nor do they surpass the
 faculty of nature; as when people are cured of a fever. Nor are they
 beyond our hopes, since we all hope for the resurrection of the dead,
 which nevertheless will be outside the course of nature. Therefore
 not all things are outside the course of nature are miraculous.
"," Further, the word miracle is derived from admiration. Now
 admiration concerns things manifest to the senses. But sometimes
 things happen outside the order of nature, which are not manifest to
 the senses; as when the Apostles were endowed with knowledge without
 studying or being taught. Therefore not everything that occurs
 outside the order of nature is miraculous.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Creation, and the justification of the unrighteous,
 though done by God alone, are not, properly speaking, miracles,
 because they are not of a nature to proceed from any other cause; so
 they do not occur outside the order of nature, since they do not
 belong to that order.
"," An arduous thing is called a miracle, not on account of
 the excellence of the thing wherein it is done, but because it
 surpasses the faculty of nature: likewise a thing is called unusual,
 not because it does not often happen, but because it is outside the
 usual natural course of things. Furthermore, a thing is said to be
 above the faculty of nature, not only by reason of the substance of
 the thing done, but also on account of the manner and order in which
 it is done. Again, a miracle is said to go beyond the hope ""of
 nature,"" not above the hope ""of grace,"" which hope comes from faith,
 whereby we believe in the future resurrection.

 itself, yet was made manifest in its effect, from which it was shown
 to be wonderful.

 another. For Augustine says (Epist. ad Volusian. cxxxvii): ""In
 miraculous deeds, the whole measure of the deed is the power of the
 doer."" But by the same power of God all miracles are done. Therefore
 one miracle is not greater than another.

 exceeds the finite beyond all proportion; and therefore no more
 reason exists to wonder at one effect thereof than at another.

","Whether One Angel Enlightens Another?
"," It would seem that one angel does not enlighten another.
 For the angels possess now the same beatitude which we hope to obtain.
 But one man will not then enlighten another, according to Jer. 31:34:
 ""They shall teach no more every man his neighbor, and every man his
 brother."" Therefore neither does an angel enlighten another now.
"," Further, light in the angels is threefold; of nature, of
 grace, and of glory. But an angel is enlightened in the light of
 nature by the Creator; in the light of grace by the Justifier; in
 the light of glory by the Beatifier; all of which comes from God.
 Therefore one angel does not enlighten another.
"," Further, light is a form in the mind. But the rational
 mind is ""informed by God alone, without created intervention,"" as
 Augustine says (QQ. 83, qu. 51). Therefore one angel does not
 enlighten the mind of another.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," All the angels, both inferior and superior, see the
 Essence of God immediately, and in this respect one does not teach
 another. It is of this truth that the prophet speaks; wherefore he
 adds: ""They shall teach no more every man his brother, saying: 'Know
 the Lord': for all shall know Me, from the least of them even to the
 greatest."" But all the types of the Divine works, which are known in
 God as in their cause, God knows in Himself, because He comprehends
 Himself; but of others who see God, each one knows the more types,
 the more perfectly he sees God. Hence a superior angel knows more
 about the types of the Divine works than an inferior angel, and
 concerning these the former enlightens the latter; and as to this
 Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv) that the angels ""are enlightened by
 the types of existing things.""
"," An angel does not enlighten another by giving him the
 light of nature, grace, or glory; but by strengthening his natural
 light, and by manifesting to him the truth concerning the state of
 nature, of grace, and of glory, as explained above.
"," The rational mind is formed immediately by God, either
 as the image from the exemplar, forasmuch as it is made to the image
 of God alone; or as the subject by the ultimate perfecting form: for
 the created mind is always considered to be unformed, except it
 adhere to the first truth; while the other kinds of enlightenment
 that proceed from man or angel, are, as it were, dispositions to
 this ultimate form.

","Whether one angel moves another angel's will?
"," It would seem that one angel can move another angel's
 will. Because, according to Dionysius quoted above (A. 1), as one
 angel enlightens another, so does he cleanse and perfect another. But
 cleansing and perfecting seem to belong to the will: for the former
 seems to point to the stain of sin which appertains to will; while to
 be perfected is to obtain an end, which is the object of the will.
 Therefore an angel can move another angel's will.
"," Further, as Dionysius says (Coel. Hier. vii): ""The names of
 the angels designate their properties."" Now the Seraphim are so
 called because they ""kindle"" or ""give heat"": and this is by love
 which belongs to the will. Therefore one angel moves another angel's
 will.
"," Further, the Philosopher says (De Anima iii, 11) that the
 higher appetite moves the lower. But as the intellect of the superior
 angel is higher, so also is his will. It seems, therefore, that the
 superior angel can change the will of another angel.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Cleansing and perfecting are to be understood according
 to the mode of enlightenment. And since God enlightens by changing
 the intellect and will, He cleanses by removing defects of intellect
 and will, and perfects unto the end of the intellect and will. But
 the enlightenment caused by an angel concerns the intellect, as
 explained above (A. 1); therefore an angel is to be understood as
 cleansing from the defect of nescience in the intellect; and as
 perfecting unto the consummate end of the intellect, and this is the
 knowledge of truth. Thus Dionysius says (Eccl. Hier. vi): that ""in
 the heavenly hierarchy the chastening of the inferior essence is an
 enlightening of things unknown, that leads them to more perfect
 knowledge."" For instance, we might say that corporeal sight is
 cleansed by the removal of darkness; enlightened by the diffusion of
 light; and perfected by being brought to the perception of the
 colored object.
"," One angel can induce another to love God by persuasion
 as explained above.
"," The Philosopher speaks of the lower sensitive appetite
 which can be moved by the superior intellectual appetite, because it
 belongs to the same nature of the soul, and because the inferior
 appetite is a power in a corporeal organ. But this does not apply to
 the angels.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
519,"[I, Q. 106, Art. 3]
","Whether an Inferior Angel Can Enlighten a Superior Angel?
"," It would seem that an inferior angel can enlighten a
 superior angel. For the ecclesiastical hierarchy is derived from, and
 represents the heavenly hierarchy; and hence the heavenly Jerusalem is
 called ""our mother"" (Gal. 4:26). But in the Church even superiors are
 enlightened and taught by their inferiors, as the Apostle says (1 Cor.
 14:31): ""You may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn and all
 may be exhorted."" Therefore, likewise in the heavenly hierarchy, the
 superiors can be enlightened by inferiors.
"," Further, as the order of corporeal substances depends on the
 will of God, so also does the order of spiritual substances. But, as
 was said above (Q. 105, A. 6), God sometimes acts outside the order
 of corporeal substances. Therefore He also sometimes acts outside the
 order of spiritual substances, by enlightening inferior otherwise
 than through their superiors. Therefore in that way the inferiors
 enlightened by God can enlighten superiors.
"," Further, one angel enlightens the other to whom he turns, as
 was above explained (A. 1). But since this turning to another is
 voluntary, the highest angel can turn to the lowest passing over the
 others. Therefore he can enlighten him immediately; and thus the
 latter can enlighten his superiors.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The ecclesiastical hierarchy imitates the heavenly in
 some degree, but not by a perfect likeness. For in the heavenly
 hierarchy the perfection of the order is in proportion to its
 nearness to God; so that those who are the nearer to God are the more
 sublime in grade, and more clear in knowledge; and on that account
 the superiors are never enlightened by the inferiors, whereas in the
 ecclesiastical hierarchy, sometimes those who are the nearer to God
 in sanctity, are in the lowest grade, and are not conspicuous for
 science; and some also are eminent in one kind of science, and fail
 in another; and on that account superiors may be taught by inferiors.
"," As above explained, there is no similarity between what
 God does outside the order of corporeal nature, and that of spiritual
 nature. Hence the argument does not hold.
"," An angel turns voluntarily to enlighten another angel,
 but the angel's will is ever regulated by the Divine law which made
 the order in the angels.

520,"[I, Q. 106, Art. 4]
","Whether the Superior Angel Enlightens the Inferior As Regards All He
"," It would seem that the superior angel does not enlighten
 the inferior concerning all he himself knows. For Dionysius says
 (Coel. Hier. xii) that the superior angels have a more universal
 knowledge; and the inferior a more particular and individual
 knowledge. But more is contained under a universal knowledge than
 under a particular knowledge. Therefore not all that the superior
 angels know, is known by the inferior, through these being
 enlightened by the former.
"," Further, the Master of the Sentences (ii, D, 11) says that
 the superior angels had long known the Mystery of the Incarnation,
 whereas the inferior angels did not know it until it was
 accomplished. Thus we find that on some of the angels inquiring, as
 it were, in ignorance: ""Who is this King of glory?"" other angels, who
 knew, answered: ""The Lord of Hosts, He is the King of glory,"" as
 Dionysius expounds (Coel. Hier. vii). But this would not apply if the
 superior angels enlightened the inferior concerning all they know
 themselves. Therefore they do not do so.
"," Further, if the superior angels enlighten the inferior about
 all they know, nothing that the superior angels know would be unknown
 to the inferior angels. Therefore the superior angels could
 communicate nothing more to the inferior; which appears open to
 objection. Therefore the superior angels enlighten the inferior in
 all things.

 universal as regards the more eminent mode of knowledge.
"," The Master's words are not to be understood as if the

 angels; and that they progressed in the knowledge of it afterwards
 when the Mystery was accomplished.

521,"[I, Q. 107, Art. 1]
","Whether One Angel Speaks to Another?
"," It would seem that one angel does not speak to another.
 For Gregory says (Moral. xviii) that, in the state of the resurrection
 ""each one's body will not hide his mind from his fellows."" Much less,
 therefore, is one angel's mind hidden from another. But speech
 manifests to another what lies hidden in the mind. Therefore it is not
 necessary that one angel should speak to another.
"," Further, speech is twofold; interior, whereby one speaks to
 oneself; and exterior, whereby one speaks to another. But exterior
 speech takes place by some sensible sign, as by voice, or gesture, or
 some bodily member, as the tongue, or the fingers, and this cannot
 apply to the angels. Therefore one angel does not speak to another.
"," Further, the speaker incites the hearer to listen to what he
 says. But it does not appear that one angel incites another to
 listen; for this happens among us by some sensible sign. Therefore
 one angel does not speak to another.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Our mental concept is hidden by a twofold obstacle. The
 first is in the will, which can retain the mental concept within, or
 can direct it externally. In this way God alone can see the mind of
 another, according to 1 Cor. 2:11: ""What man knoweth the things of a
 man, but the spirit of a man that is in him?"" The other obstacle
 whereby the mental concept is excluded from another one's knowledge,
 comes from the body; and so it happens that even when the will
 directs the concept of the mind to make itself known, it is not at
 once make known to another; but some sensible sign must be used.
 Gregory alludes to this fact when he says (Moral. ii): ""To other eyes
 we seem to stand aloof as it were behind the wall of the body; and
 when we wish to make ourselves known, we go out as it were by the
 door of the tongue to show what we really are."" But an angel is under
 no such obstacle, and so he can make his concept known to another at
 once.
"," External speech, made by the voice, is a necessity for
 us on account of the obstacle of the body. Hence it does not befit an
 angel; but only interior speech belongs to him, and this includes not
 only the interior speech by mental concept, but also its being
 ordered to another's knowledge by the will. So the tongue of an angel
 is called metaphorically the angel's power, whereby he manifests his
 mental concept.
"," There is no need to draw the attention of the good
 angels, inasmuch as they always see each other in the Word; for as
 one ever sees the other, so he ever sees what is ordered to himself.
 But because by their very nature they can speak to each other, and
 even now the bad angels speak to each other, we must say that the
 intellect is moved by the intelligible object just as sense is
 affected by the sensible object. Therefore, as sense is aroused by
 the sensible object, so the mind of an angel can be aroused to
 attention by some intelligible power.

522,"[I, Q. 107, Art. 2]
","Whether the Inferior Angel Speaks to the Superior?
"," It would seem that the inferior angel does not speak to
 the superior. For on the text (1 Cor. 13:1), ""If I speak with the
 tongues of men and of angels,"" a gloss remarks that the speech of the
 angels is an enlightenment whereby the superior enlightens the
 inferior. But the inferior never enlightens the superior, as was
 above explained (Q. 106, A. 3). Therefore neither do the inferior
 speak to the superior.
"," Further, as was said above (Q. 106, A. 1), to enlighten means
 merely to acquaint one man of what is known to another; and this is
 to speak. Therefore to speak and to enlighten are the same; so the
 same conclusion follows.
"," Further, Gregory says (Moral. ii): ""God speaks to the angels
 by the very fact that He shows to their hearts His hidden and
 invisible things."" But this is to enlighten them. Therefore, whenever
 God speaks, He enlightens. In the same way every angelic speech is an
 enlightening. Therefore an inferior angel can in no way speak to a
 superior angel.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Every speech of God to the angels is an enlightening;
 because since the will of God is the rule of truth, it belongs to the
 perfection and enlightenment of the created mind to know even what
 God wills. But the same does not apply to the will of the angels, as
 was explained above.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
523,"[I, Q. 107, Art. 3]
","Whether an Angel Speaks to God?
"," It would seem that an angel does not speak to God. For
 speech makes known something to another. But an angel cannot make
 known anything to God, Who knows all things. Therefore an angel does
 not speak to God.
"," Further, to speak is to order the mental concept in reference
 to another, as was shown above (A. 1). But an angel ever orders his
 mental concept to God. So if an angel speaks to God, he ever speaks
 to God; which in some ways appears to be unreasonable, since an angel
 sometimes speaks to another angel. Therefore it seems that an angel
 never speaks to God.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Speech is not always for the purpose of making
 something known to another; but is sometimes finally ordered to the
 purpose of manifesting something to the speaker himself; as when the
 disciples ask instruction from the master.
"," The angels are ever speaking to God in the sense of
 praising and admiring Him and His works; but they speak to Him by
 consulting Him about what ought to be done whenever they have to
 perform any new work, concerning which they desire enlightenment.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
524,"[I, Q. 107, Art. 4]
","Whether Local Distance Influences the Angelic Speech?
"," It would seem that local distance affects the angelic
 speech. For as Damascene says (De Fide Orth. i, 13): ""An angel works
 where he is."" But speech is an angelic operation. Therefore, as an
 angel is in a determinate place, it seems that an angel's speech is
 limited by the bounds of that place.
"," Further, a speaker cries out on account of the distance of
 the hearer. But it is said of the Seraphim that ""they cried one to
 another"" (Isa. 6:3). Therefore in the angelic speech local distance
 has some effect.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The angelic speech, as above explained (A. 1, ad 2), is
 interior; perceived, nevertheless, by another; and therefore it
 exists in the angel who speaks, and consequently where the angel is
 who speaks. But as local distance does not prevent one angel seeing
 another, so neither does it prevent an angel perceiving what is
 ordered to him on the part of another; and this is to perceive his
 speech.
"," The cry mentioned is not a bodily voice raised by
 reason of the local distance; but is taken to signify the magnitude
 of what is said, or the intensity of the affection, according to what
 Gregory says (Moral. ii): ""The less one desires, the less one cries
 out.""
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
525,"[I, Q. 107, Art. 5]
","Whether All the Angels Know What One Speaks to Another?
"," It would seem that all the angels know what one speaks
 to another. For unequal local distance is the reason why all men do
 not know what one man says to another. But in the angelic speech
 local distance has no effect, as above explained (A. 4). Therefore
 all the angels know what one speaks to another.
"," Further, all the angels have the intellectual power in
 common. So if the mental concept of one ordered to another is known
 by one, it is for the same reason known by all.
"," Further, enlightenment is a kind of speech. But the
 enlightenment of one angel by another extends to all the angels,
 because, as Dionysius says (Coel. Hier. xv): ""Each one of the
 heavenly beings communicates what he learns to the others."" Therefore
 the speech of one angel to another extends to all.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Enlightenment is of those truths that emanate from the
 first rule of truth, which is the principle common to all the angels;
 and in that way all enlightenments are common to all. But speech may
 be of something ordered to the principle of the created will, which
 is proper to each angel; and in this way it is not necessary that
 these speeches should be common to all.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
526,"[I, Q. 108, Art. 1]
","Whether All the Angels Are of One Hierarchy?
"," It would seem that all the angels belong to one
 hierarchy. For since the angels are supreme among creatures, it is
 evident that they are ordered for the best. But the best ordering of
 a multitude is for it to be governed by one authority, as the
 Philosopher shows (Metaph. xii, Did. xi, 10; Polit. iii, 4).
 Therefore as a hierarchy is nothing but a sacred principality, it
 seems that all the angels belong to one hierarchy.
"," Further, Dionysius says (Coel. Hier. iii) that ""hierarchy is
 order, knowledge, and action."" But all the angels agree in one order
 towards God, Whom they know, and by Whom in their actions they are
 ruled. Therefore all the angels belong to one hierarchy.
"," Further, the sacred principality called hierarchy is to be
 found among men and angels. But all men are of one hierarchy.
 Therefore likewise all the angels are of one hierarchy.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," This objection considers principality on the part of
 the ruler, inasmuch as a multitude is best ruled by one ruler, as
 the Philosopher asserts in those passages.
"," As regards knowing God Himself, Whom all see in one
 way--that is, in His essence--there is no hierarchical distinction
 among the angels; but there is such a distinction as regards the
 types of created things, as above explained.
"," All men are of one species, and have one connatural
 mode of understanding; which is not the case in the angels: and
 hence the same argument does not apply to both.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
527,"[I, Q. 108, Art. 2]
","Whether There Are Several Orders in One Hierarchy?
"," It would seem that in the one hierarchy there are not
 several orders. For when a definition is multiplied, the thing defined
 is also multiplied. But hierarchy is order, as Dionysius says (Coel.
 Hier. iii). Therefore, if there are many orders, there is not one
 hierarchy only, but many.
"," Further, different orders are different grades, and grades
 among spirits are constituted by different spiritual gifts. But among
 the angels all the spiritual gifts are common to all, for ""nothing is
 possessed individually"" (Sent. ii, D, ix). Therefore there are not
 different orders of angels.
"," Further, in the ecclesiastical hierarchy the orders are
 distinguished according to the actions of ""cleansing,""
 ""enlightening,"" and ""perfecting."" For the order of deacons is
 ""cleansing,"" the order of priests, is ""enlightening,"" and of bishops
 ""perfecting,"" as Dionysius says (Eccl. Hier. v). But each of the
 angels cleanses, enlightens, and perfects. Therefore there is no
 distinction of orders among the angels.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Order is twofold. In one way it is taken as the order
 comprehending in itself different grades; and in that way a hierarchy
 is called an order. In another way one grade is called an order; and
 in that sense the several orders of one hierarchy are so called.
"," All things are possessed in common by the angelic
 society, some things, however, being held more excellently by some
 than by others. Each gift is more perfectly possessed by the one who
 can communicate it, than by the one who cannot communicate it; as the
 hot thing which can communicate heat is more perfect that what is
 unable to give heat. And the more perfectly anyone can communicate a
 gift, the higher grade he occupies, as he is in the more perfect
 grade of mastership who can teach a higher science. By this
 similitude we can reckon the diversity of grades or orders among the
 angels, according to their different offices and actions.
"," The inferior angel is superior to the highest man of
 our hierarchy, according to the words, ""He that is the lesser in the
 kingdom of heaven, is greater than he""--namely, John the Baptist,
 than whom ""there hath not risen a greater among them that are born of
 women"" (Matt. 11:11). Hence the lesser angel of the heavenly
 hierarchy can not only cleanse, but also enlighten and perfect, and
 in a higher way than can the orders of our hierarchy. Thus the
 heavenly orders are not distinguished by reason of these, but by
 reason of other different acts.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
528,"[I, Q. 108, Art. 3]
","Whether There Are Many Angels in One Order?
"," It seems that there are not many angels in one order.
 For it was shown above (Q. 50, A. 4), that all the angels are
 unequal. But equals belong to one order. Therefore there are not many
 angels in one order.
"," Further, it is superfluous for a thing to be done by many,
 which can be done sufficiently by one. But that which belongs to one
 angelic office can be done sufficiently by one angel; so much more
 sufficiently than the one sun does what belongs to the office of the
 sun, as the angel is more perfect than a heavenly body. If,
 therefore, the orders are distinguished by their offices, as stated
 above (A. 2), several angels in one order would be superfluous.
"," Further, it was said above (Obj. 1) that all the angels are
 unequal. Therefore, if several angels (for instance, three or four),
 are of one order, the lowest one of the superior order will be more
 akin to the highest of the inferior order than with the highest of
 his own order; and thus he does not seem to be more of one order with
 the latter than with the former. Therefore there are not many angels
 of one order.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," All the angels of one order are in some way equal in a
 common similitude, whereby they are placed in that order; but
 absolutely speaking they are not equal. Hence Dionysius says (Coel.
 Hier. x) that in one and the same order of angels there are those who
 are first, middle, and last.
"," That special distinction of orders and offices wherein
 each angel has his own office and order, is hidden from us.
"," As in a surface which is partly white and partly black,
 the two parts on the borders of white and black are more akin as
 regards their position than any other two white parts, but are less
 akin in quality; so two angels who are on the boundary of two orders
 are more akin in propinquity of nature than one of them is akin to
 the others of its own order, but less akin in their fitness for
 similar offices, which fitness, indeed, extends to a definite limit.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
529,"[I, Q. 108, Art. 4]
","Whether the Distinction of Hierarchies and Orders Comes from the
"," It would seem that the distinction of hierarchies and of
 orders is not from the nature of the angels. For hierarchy is ""a
 sacred principality,"" and Dionysius places in its definition that it
 ""approaches a resemblance to God, as far as may be"" (Coel. Hier. iii).
 But sanctity and resemblance to God is in the angels by grace, and not
 by nature. Therefore the distinction of hierarchies and orders in the
 angels is by grace, and not by nature.
"," Further, the Seraphim are called ""burning"" or ""kindling,"" as
 Dionysius says (Coel. Hier. vii). This belongs to charity which comes
 not from nature but from grace; for ""it is poured forth in our hearts
 by the Holy Ghost Who is given to us"" (Rom. 5:5): ""which is said not
 only of holy men, but also of the holy angels,"" as Augustine says (De
 Civ. Dei xii). Therefore the angelic orders are not from nature, but
 from grace.
"," Further, the ecclesiastical hierarchy is copied from the
 heavenly. But the orders among men are not from nature, but by the
 gift of grace; for it is not a natural gift for one to be a bishop,
 and another a priest, and another a deacon. Therefore neither in the
 angels are the orders from nature, but from grace only.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
530,"[I, Q. 108, Art. 5]
","Whether the Orders of the Angels Are Properly Named?
"," It would seem that the orders of the angels are not
 properly named. For all the heavenly spirits are called angels and
 heavenly virtues. But common names should not be appropriated to
 individuals. Therefore the orders of the angels and virtues are
 ineptly named.
"," Further, it belongs to God alone to be Lord, according to the
 words, ""Know ye that the Lord He is God"" (Ps. 99:3). Therefore one
 order of the heavenly spirits is not properly called ""Dominations.""
"," Further, the name ""Domination"" seems to imply government and
 likewise the names ""Principalities"" and ""Powers."" Therefore these
 three names do not seem to be properly applied to three orders.
"," Further, archangels are as it were angel princes. Therefore
 this name ought not to be given to any other order than to the
 ""Principalities.""
"," Further, the name ""Seraphim"" is derived from ardor, which
 pertains to charity; and the name ""Cherubim"" from knowledge. But
 charity and knowledge are gifts common to all the angels. Therefore
 they ought not to be names of any particular orders.
"," Further, Thrones are seats. But from the fact that God knows
 and loves the rational creature He is said to sit within it.
 Therefore there ought not to be any order of ""Thrones"" besides the
 ""Cherubim"" and ""Seraphim."" Therefore it appears that the orders of
 angels are not properly styled.
",,,,,,,,,,,," Angel means ""messenger."" So all the heavenly spirits,
 so far as they make known Divine things, are called ""angels."" But
 the superior angels enjoy a certain excellence, as regards this
 manifestation, from which the superior orders are denominated. The
 lowest order of angels possess no excellence above the common
 manifestation; and therefore it is denominated from manifestation
 only; and thus the common name remains as it were proper to the
 lowest order, as Dionysius says (Coel. Hier. v). Or we may say that
 the lowest order can be specially called the order of ""angels,""
 forasmuch as they announce things to us immediately.
"," As Dionysius says (Div. Nom. xii): ""Dominion is
 attributed to God in a special manner, by way of excess: but the
 Divine word gives the more illustrious heavenly princes the name of
 Lord by participation, through whom the inferior angels receive the
 Divine gifts."" Hence Dionysius also states (Coel. Hier. viii) that
 the name ""Domination"" means first ""a certain liberty, free from
 servile condition and common subjection, such as that of plebeians,
 and from tyrannical oppression,"" endured sometimes even by the great.
 Secondly, it signifies ""a certain rigid and inflexible supremacy
 which does not bend to any servile act, or to the act of those who
 are subject to or oppressed by tyrants."" Thirdly, it signifies ""the
 desire and participation of the true dominion which belongs to God.""
 Likewise the name of each order signifies the participation of what
 belongs to God; as the name ""Virtues"" signifies the participation of
 the Divine virtue; and the same principle applies to the rest.
"," The names ""Domination,"" ""Power,"" and ""Principality""
 belong to government in different ways. The place of a lord is only
 to prescribe what is to be done. So Gregory says (Hom. xxiv in
 Evang.), that ""some companies of the angels, because others are
 subject to obedience to them, are called dominations."" The name
 ""Power"" points out a kind of order, according to what the Apostle
 says, ""He that resisteth the power, resisteth the ordination of God""
 (Rom. 13:2). And so Dionysius says (Coel. Hier. viii) that the name
 ""Power"" signifies a kind of ordination both as regards the reception
 of Divine things, and as regards the Divine actions performed by
 superiors towards inferiors by leading them to things above.
 Therefore, to the order of ""Powers"" it belongs to regulate what is to
 be done by those who are subject to them. To preside [principari] as
 Gregory says (Hom. xxiv in Ev.) is ""to be first among others,"" as
 being first in carrying out what is ordered to be done. And so
 Dionysius says (Coel. Hier. ix) that the name of ""Principalities""
 signifies ""one who leads in a sacred order."" For those who lead
 others, being first among them, are properly called ""princes,""
 according to the words, ""Princes went before joined with singers""
 (Ps. 67:26).
"," The ""Archangels,"" according to Dionysius (Coel. Hier.
 ix), are between the ""Principalities"" and the ""Angels."" A medium
 compared to one extreme seems like the other, as participating in the
 nature of both extremes; thus tepid seems cold compared to hot, and
 hot compared to cold. So the ""Archangels"" are called the ""angel
 princes""; forasmuch as they are princes as regards the ""Angels,"" and
 angels as regards the Principalities. But according to Gregory (Hom.
 xxiv in Ev.) they are called ""Archangels,"" because they preside over
 the one order of the ""Angels""; as it were, announcing greater things:
 and the ""Principalities"" are so called as presiding over all the
 heavenly ""Virtues"" who fulfil the Divine commands.
"," The name ""Seraphim"" does not come from charity only,
 but from the excess of charity, expressed by the word ardor or fire.
 Hence Dionysius (Coel. Hier. vii) expounds the name ""Seraphim""
 according to the properties of fire, containing an excess of heat.
 Now in fire we may consider three things. First, the movement which
 is upwards and continuous. This signifies that they are borne
 inflexibly towards God. Secondly, the active force which is ""heat,""
 which is not found in fire simply, but exists with a certain
 sharpness, as being of most penetrating action, and reaching even to
 the smallest things, and as it were, with superabundant fervor;
 whereby is signified the action of these angels, exercised powerfully
 upon those who are subject to them, rousing them to a like fervor,
 and cleansing them wholly by their heat. Thirdly we consider in fire
 the quality of clarity, or brightness; which signifies that these
 angels have in themselves an inextinguishable light, and that they
 also perfectly enlighten others.
"," The order of the ""Thrones"" excels the inferior orders
 as having an immediate knowledge of the types of the Divine works;
 whereas the ""Cherubim"" have the excellence of knowledge and the
 ""Seraphim"" the excellence of ardor. And although these two excellent
 attributes include the third, yet the gift belonging to the ""Thrones""
 does not include the other two; and so the order of the ""Thrones"" is
 distinguished from the orders of the ""Cherubim"" and the ""Seraphim.""
 For it is a common rule in all things that the excellence of the
 inferior is contained in the superior, but not conversely. But
 Dionysius (Coel. Hier. vii) explains the name ""Thrones"" by its
 relation to material seats, in which we may consider four things.
 First, the site; because seats are raised above the earth, and to
 the angels who are called ""Thrones"" are raised up to the immediate
 knowledge of the types of things in God. Secondly, because in
 material seats is displayed strength, forasmuch as a person sits
 firmly on them. But here the reverse is the case; for the angels
 themselves are made firm by God. Thirdly, because the seat receives
 him who sits thereon, and he can be carried thereupon; and so the
 angels receive God in themselves, and in a certain way bear Him to
 the inferior creatures. Fourthly, because in its shape, a seat is
 open on one side to receive the sitter; and thus are the angels
 promptly open to receive God and to serve Him.
",,,,,,,,,,
531,"[I, Q. 108, Art. 6]
","Whether the Grades of the Orders Are Properly Assigned?
"," It would seem that the grades of the orders are not
 properly assigned. For the order of prelates is the highest. But the
 names of ""Dominations,"" ""Principalities,"" and ""Powers"" of themselves
 imply prelacy. Therefore these orders ought not to be supreme.
"," Further, the nearer an order is to God, the higher it is. But
 the order of ""Thrones"" is the nearest to God; for nothing is nearer
 to the sitter than the seat. Therefore the order of the ""Thrones"" is
 the highest.
"," Further, knowledge comes before love, and intellect is higher
 than will. Therefore the order of ""Cherubim"" seems to be higher than
 the ""Seraphim.""
"," Further, Gregory (Hom. xxiv in Evang.) places the
 ""Principalities"" above the ""Powers."" These therefore are not placed
 immediately above the Archangels, as Dionysius says (Coel. Hier. ix).
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," The angels' subjection to God is greater than their
 presiding over inferior things; and the latter is derived from the
 former. Thus the orders which derive their name from presiding are
 not the first and highest; but rather the orders deriving their name
 from their nearness and relation to God.
"," The nearness to God designated by the name of the
 ""Thrones,"" belongs also to the ""Cherubim"" and ""Seraphim,"" and in a
 more excellent way, as above explained.
"," As above explained (Q. 27, A. 3), knowledge takes place
 accordingly as the thing known is in the knower; but love as the
 lover is united to the object loved. Now higher things are in a
 nobler way in themselves than in lower things; whereas lower things
 are in higher things in a nobler way than they are in themselves.
 Therefore to know lower things is better than to love them; and to
 love the higher things, God above all, is better than to know them.
"," A careful comparison will show that little or no
 difference exists in reality between the dispositions of the orders
 according to Dionysius and Gregory. For Gregory expounds the name
 ""Principalities"" from their ""presiding over good spirits,"" which also
 agrees with the ""Virtues"" accordingly as this name expressed a
 certain strength, giving efficacy to the inferior spirits in the
 execution of the Divine ministrations. Again, according to Gregory,
 the ""Virtues"" seem to be the same as ""Principalities"" of Dionysius.
 For to work miracles holds the first place in the Divine
 ministrations; since thereby the way is prepared for the
 announcements of the ""Archangels"" and the ""Angels.""
",,,,,,,,,,,,
532,"[I, Q. 108, Art. 7]
","Whether the Orders Will Outlast the Day of Judgment?
"," It would seem that the orders of angels will not outlast
 the Day of Judgment. For the Apostle says (1 Cor. 15:24), that Christ
 will ""bring to naught all principality and power, when He shall have
 delivered up the kingdom to God and the Father,"" and this will be in
 the final consummation. Therefore for the same reason all others will
 be abolished in that state.
"," Further, to the office of the angelic orders it belongs to
 cleanse, enlighten, and perfect. But after the Day of Judgment one
 angel will not cleanse, enlighten, or perfect another, because they
 will not advance any more in knowledge. Therefore the angelic orders
 would remain for no purpose.
"," Further, the Apostle says of the angels (Heb. 1:14), that
 ""they are all ministering spirits, sent to minister to them who shall
 receive the inheritance of salvation""; whence it appears that the
 angelic offices are ordered for the purpose of leading men to
 salvation. But all the elect are in pursuit of salvation until the
 Day of Judgment. Therefore the angelic offices and orders will not
 outlast the Day of Judgment.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The principalities and powers will come to an end in
 that final consummation as regards their office of leading others
 to their end; because when the end is attained, it is no longer
 necessary to tend towards the end. This is clear from the words of
 the Apostle, ""When He shall have delivered up the kingdom of God
 and the Father,"" i.e. when He shall have led the faithful to the
 enjoyment of God Himself.
"," The actions of angels over the other angels are to be
 considered according to a likeness to our own intellectual actions.
 In ourselves we find many intellectual actions which are ordered
 according to the order of cause and effect; as when we gradually
 arrive at one conclusion by many middle terms. Now it is manifest
 that the knowledge of a conclusion depends on all the preceding
 middle terms not only in the new acquisition of knowledge, but also
 as regards the keeping of the knowledge acquired. A proof of this is
 that when anyone forgets any of the preceding middle terms he can
 have opinion or belief about the conclusion, but not knowledge; as he
 is ignorant of the order of the causes. So, since the inferior angels
 know the types of the Divine works by the light of the superior
 angels, their knowledge depends on the light of the superior angels
 not only as regards the acquisition of knowledge, but also as regards
 the preserving of the knowledge possessed. So, although after the
 Judgment the inferior angels will not progress in the knowledge of
 some things, still this will not prevent their being enlightened by
 the superior angels.
"," Although after the Day of Judgment men will not be led
 any more to salvation by the ministry of the angels, still those who
 are already saved will be enlightened through the angelic ministry.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
533,"[I, Q. 108, Art. 8]
","Whether Men Are Taken Up into the Angelic Orders?
"," It would seem that men are not taken up into the orders
 of the angels. For the human hierarchy is stationed beneath the lowest
 heavenly hierarchy, as the lowest under the middle hierarchy and the
 middle beneath the first. But the angels of the lowest hierarchy are
 never transferred into the middle, or the first. Therefore neither are
 men transferred to the angelic orders.
"," Further, certain offices belong to the orders of the angels,
 as to guard, to work miracles, to coerce the demons, and the like;
 which do not appear to belong to the souls of the saints. Therefore
 they are not transferred to the angelic orders.
"," Further, as the good angels lead on to good, so do the demons
 to what is evil. But it is erroneous to say that the souls of bad men
 are changed into demons; for Chrysostom rejects this (Hom. xxviii in
 Matt.). Therefore it does not seem that the souls of the saints will
 be transferred to the orders of angels.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Grace is given to the angels in proportion to their
 natural gifts. This, however, does not apply to men, as above
 explained (A. 4; Q. 62, A. 6). So, as the inferior angels cannot be
 transferred to the natural grade of the superior, neither can they be
 transferred to the superior grade of grace; whereas men can ascend to
 the grade of grace, but not of nature.
"," The angels according to the order of nature are between
 us and God; and therefore according to the common law not only human
 affairs are administered by them, but also all corporeal matters. But
 holy men even after this life are of the same nature with ourselves;
 and hence according to the common law they do not administer human
 affairs, ""nor do they interfere in the things of the living,"" as
 Augustine says (De cura pro mortuis xiii, xvi). Still, by a certain
 special dispensation it is sometimes granted to some of the saints to
 exercise these offices; by working miracles, by coercing the demons,
 or by doing something of that kind, as Augustine says (De cura pro
 mortuis xvi).
"," It is not erroneous to say that men are transferred to
 the penalty of demons; but some erroneously stated that the demons
 are nothing but souls of the dead; and it is this that Chrysostom
 rejects.

534,"[I, Q. 109, Art. 1]
","Whether There Are Orders Among the Demons?
"," It would seem that there are no orders among the demons.
 For order belongs to good, as also mode, and species, as Augustine
 says (De Nat. Boni iii); and on the contrary, disorder belongs to
 evil. But there is nothing disorderly in the good angels. Therefore
 in the bad angels there are no orders.
"," Further, the angelic orders are contained under a hierarchy.
 But the demons are not in a hierarchy, which is defined as a holy
 principality; for they are void of all holiness. Therefore among the
 demons there are no orders.
"," Further, the demons fell from every one of the angelic
 orders; as is commonly supposed. Therefore, if some demons are said
 to belong to an order, as falling from that order, it would seem
 necessary to give them the names of each of those orders. But we
 never find that they are called ""Seraphim,"" or ""Thrones,"" or
 ""Dominations."" Therefore on the same ground they are not to be placed
 in any other order.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Good can exist without evil; whereas evil cannot exist
 without good (Q. 49, A. 3); so there is order in the demons, as
 possessing a good nature.
"," If we consider the ordering of the demons on the part
 of God Who orders them, it is sacred; for He uses the demons for
 Himself; but on the part of the demons' will it is not a sacred
 thing, because they abuse their nature for evil.
"," The name ""Seraphim"" is given from the ardor of charity;
 and the name ""Thrones"" from the Divine indwelling; and the name
 ""Dominations"" imports a certain liberty; all of which are opposed to
 sin; and therefore these names are not given to the angels who sinned.

","Whether among the demons there is precedence?
"," It would seem that there is no precedence among the
 demons. For every precedence is according to some order of justice.
 But the demons are wholly fallen from justice. Therefore there is no
 precedence among them.
"," Further, there is no precedence where obedience and
 subjection do not exist. But these cannot be without concord; which
 is not to be found among the demons, according to the text, ""Among
 the proud there are always contentions"" (Prov. 13:10). Therefore
 there is no precedence among the demons.
"," If there be precedence among them it is either according to
 nature, or according to their sin or punishment. But it is not
 according to their nature, for subjection and service do not come
 from nature but from subsequent sin; neither is it according to sin
 or punishment, because in that case the superior demons who have
 sinned the most grievously, would be subject to the inferior.
 Therefore there is no precedence among the demons.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The authority of the demons is not founded on
 their justice, but on the justice of God ordering all things.
"," The concord of the demons, whereby some obey
 others, does not arise from mutual friendships, but from their common
 wickedness whereby they hate men, and fight against God's justice. For
 it belongs to wicked men to be joined to and subject to those whom
 they see to be stronger, in order to carry out their own wickedness.
"," The demons are not equal in nature; and so among
 them there exists a natural precedence; which is not the case with
 men, who are naturally equal. That the inferior are subject to the
 superior, is not for the benefit of the superior, but rather to their
 detriment; because since to do evil belongs in a pre-eminent degree to
 unhappiness, it follows that to preside in evil is to be more unhappy.

536,"[I, Q. 109, Art. 3]
","Whether There Is Enlightenment in the Demons?
"," It would seem that enlightenment is in the demons. For
 enlightenment means the manifestation of the truth. But one demon can
 manifest truth to another, because the superior excel in natural
 knowledge. Therefore the superior demons can enlighten the inferior.
"," Further, a body abounding in light can enlighten a body
 deficient in light, as the sun enlightens the moon. But the superior
 demons abound in the participation of natural light. Therefore it
 seems that the superior demons can enlighten the inferior.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Not every kind of manifestation of the truth is
 enlightenment, but only that which is above described.
"," According to what belongs to natural knowledge, there
 is no necessary manifestation of the truth either in the angels, or
 in the demons, because, as above explained (Q. 55, A. 2; Q. 58, A. 2;
 Q. 79, A. 2), they know from the first all that belongs to their
 natural knowledge. So the greater fulness of natural light in the
 superior demons does not prove that they can enlighten others.

537,"[I, Q. 109, Art. 4]
","Whether the Good Angels Have Precedence Over the Bad Angels?
"," It would seem that the good angels have no precedence
 over the bad angels. For the angels' precedence is especially
 connected with enlightenment. But the bad angels, being darkness, are
 not enlightened by the good angels. Therefore the good angels do not
 rule over the bad.
"," Further, superiors are responsible as regards negligence
 for the evil deeds of their subjects. But the demons do much evil.
 Therefore if they are subject to the good angels, it seems that
 negligence is to be charged to the good angels; which cannot be
 admitted.
"," Further, the angels' precedence follows upon the order of
 nature, as above explained (A. 2). But if the demons fell from every
 order, as is commonly said, many of the demons are superior to many
 good angels in the natural order. Therefore the good angels have no
 precedence over all the bad angels.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Many things concerning Divine mysteries are made known
 by the holy angels to the bad angels, whenever the Divine justice
 requires the demons to do anything for the punishment of the evil; or
 for the trial of the good; as in human affairs the judge's assessors
 make known his sentence to the executioners. This revelation, if
 compared to the angelic revealers, can be called an enlightenment,
 forasmuch as they direct it to God; but it is not an enlightenment on
 the part of the demons, for these do not direct it to God; but to the
 fulfilment of their own wickedness.
"," The holy angels are the ministers of the Divine wisdom.
 Hence as the Divine wisdom permits some evil to be done by bad angels
 or men, for the sake of the good that follows; so also the good
 angels do not entirely restrain the bad from inflicting harm.
"," An angel who is inferior in the natural order presides
 over demons, although these may be naturally superior; because the
 power of Divine justice to which the good angels cleave, is stronger
 than the natural power of the angels. Hence likewise among men, ""the
 spiritual man judgeth all things"" (1 Cor. 2:15), and the Philosopher
 says (Ethic. iii, 4; x, 5) that ""the virtuous man is the rule and
 measure of all human acts.""

","Whether the Corporeal Creature Is Governed by the Angels?
"," It would seem that the corporeal creature is not
 governed by angels. For whatever possesses a determinate mode of
 action, needs not to be governed by any superior power; for we
 require to be governed lest we do what we ought not. But corporeal
 things have their actions determined by the nature divinely bestowed
 upon them. Therefore they do not need the government of angels.
"," Further, the lowest things are ruled by the superior. But
 some corporeal things are inferior, and others are superior.
 Therefore they need not be governed by the angels.
"," Further, the different orders of the angels are distinguished
 by different offices. But if corporeal creatures were ruled by the
 angels, there would be as many angelic offices as there are species
 of things. So also there would be as many orders of angels as there
 are species of things; which is against what is laid down above (Q.
 108, A. 2). Therefore the corporeal creature is not governed by
 angels.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Corporeal things have determinate actions; but they
 exercise such actions only according as they are moved; because it
 belongs to a body not to act unless moved. Hence a corporeal creature
 must be moved by a spiritual creature.
"," The reason alleged is according to the opinion of
 Aristotle who laid down (Metaph. xi, 8) that the heavenly bodies are
 moved by spiritual substances; the number of which he endeavored to
 assign according to the number of motions apparent in the heavenly
 bodies. But he did not say that there were any spiritual substances
 with immediate rule over the inferior bodies, except perhaps human
 souls; and this was because he did not consider that any operations
 were exercised in the inferior bodies except the natural ones for
 which the movement of the heavenly bodies sufficed. But because we
 assert that many things are done in the inferior bodies besides the
 natural corporeal actions, for which the movements of the heavenly
 bodies are not sufficient; therefore in our opinion we must assert
 that the angels possess an immediate presidency not only over the
 heavenly bodies, but also over the inferior bodies.
"," Philosophers have held different opinions about
 immaterial substances. For Plato laid down that immaterial substances
 were types and species of sensible bodies; and that some were more
 universal than others; and so he held that immaterial substances
 preside immediately over all sensible bodies, and different ones over
 different bodies. But Aristotle held that immaterial substances are
 not the species of sensible bodies, but something higher and more
 universal; and so he did not attribute to them any immediate
 presiding over single bodies, but only over the universal agents, the
 heavenly bodies. Avicenna followed a middle course. For he agreed
 with Plato in supposing some spiritual substance to preside
 immediately in the sphere of active and passive elements; because, as
 Plato also said, he held that the forms of these sensible things are
 derived from immaterial substances. But he differed from Plato
 because he supposed only one immaterial substance to preside over all
 inferior bodies, which he called the ""active intelligence.""

539,"[I, Q. 110, Art. 2]
","Whether Corporeal Matter Obeys the Mere Will of an Angel?
"," It would seem that corporeal matter obeys the mere will
 of an angel. For the power of an angel excels the power of the soul.
 But corporeal matter obeys a conception of the soul; for the body of
 man is changed by a conception of the soul as regards heat and cold,
 and sometimes even as regards health and sickness. Therefore much
 more is corporeal matter changed by a conception of an angel.
"," Further, whatever can be done by an inferior power, can be
 done by a superior power. Now the power of an angel is superior to
 corporeal power. But a body by its power is able to transform
 corporeal matter; as appears when fire begets fire. Therefore much
 more efficaciously can an angel by his power transform corporeal
 matter.
"," Further, all corporeal nature is under angelic
 administration, as appears above (A. 1), and thus it appears that
 bodies are as instruments to the angels, for an instrument is
 essentially a mover moved. Now in effects there is something that is
 due to the power of their principal agents, and which cannot be due
 to the power of the instrument; and this it is that takes the
 principal place in the effect. For example, digestion is due to the
 force of natural heat, which is the instrument of the nutritive soul:
 but that living flesh is thus generated is due to the power of the
 soul. Again the cutting of the wood is from the saw; but that it
 assumes the length the form of a bed is from the design of the
 [joiner's] art. Therefore the substantial form which takes the
 principal place in the corporeal effects, is due to the angelic
 power. Therefore matter obeys the angels in receiving its form.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Our soul is united to the body as the form; and so it
 is not surprising for the body to be formally changed by the soul's
 concept; especially as the movement of the sensitive appetite, which
 is accompanied with a certain bodily change, is subject to the
 command of reason. An angel, however, has not the same connection
 with natural bodies; and hence the argument does not hold.
"," Whatever an inferior power can do, that a superior
 power can do, not in the same way, but in a more excellent way; for
 example, the intellect knows sensible things in a more excellent way
 than sense knows them. So an angel can change corporeal matter in a
 more excellent way than can corporeal agents, that is by moving the
 corporeal agents themselves, as being the superior cause.
"," There is nothing to prevent some natural effect taking
 place by angelic power, for which the power of corporeal agents would
 not suffice. This, however, is not to obey an angel's will (as
 neither does matter obey the mere will of a cook, when by regulating
 the fire according to the prescription of his art he produces a dish
 that the fire could not have produced by itself); since to reduce
 matter to the act of the substantial form does not exceed the power
 of a corporeal agent; for it is natural for like to make like.

","Whether Bodies Obey the Angels As Regards Local Motion?
"," It would seem that bodies do not obey the angels in local
 motion. For the local motion of natural bodies follows on their forms.
 But the angels do not cause the forms of natural bodies, as stated
 above (A. 2). Therefore neither can they cause in them local
 motion.
"," Further, the Philosopher (Phys. viii, 7) proves that local
 motion is the first of all movements. But the angels cannot cause
 other movements by a formal change of the matter. Therefore neither
 can they cause local motion.
"," Further, the corporeal members obey the concept of the soul
 as regards local movement, as having in themselves some principle of
 life. In natural bodies, however, there is no vital principle.
 Therefore they do not obey the angels in local motion.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," There are in bodies other local movements besides those
 which result from the forms; for instance, the ebb and flow of the
 sea does not follow from the substantial form of the water, but from
 the influence of the moon; and much more can local movements result
 from the power of spiritual substances.
"," The angels, by causing local motion, as the first
 motion, can thereby cause other movements; that is, by employing
 corporeal agents to produce these effects, as a workman employs fire
 to soften iron.
"," The power of an angel is not so limited as is the power
 of the soul. Hence the motive power of the soul is limited to the
 body united to it, which is vivified by it, and by which it can move
 other things. But an angel's power is not limited to any body; hence
 it can move locally bodies not joined to it.

","Whether Angels Can Work Miracles?
"," It would seem that the angels can work miracles. For
 Gregory says (Hom. xxxiv in Evang.): ""Those spirits are called virtues
 by whom signs and miracles are usually done.""
"," Further, Augustine says (QQ. 83, qu. 79) that ""magicians work
 miracles by private contracts; good Christians by public justice, bad
 Christians by the signs of public justice."" But magicians work
 miracles because they are ""heard by the demons,"" as he says elsewhere
 in the same work [*Cf. Liber xxi, Sentent., sent. 4: among the
 supposititious works of St. Augustine]. Therefore the demons can work
 miracles. Therefore much more can the good angels.
"," Further, Augustine says in the same work [*Cf. Liber xxi,
 Sentent., sent. 4: among the supposititious works of St. Augustine]
 that ""it is not absurd to believe that all the things we see happen
 may be brought about by the lower powers that dwell in our
 atmosphere."" But when an effect of natural causes is produced outside
 the order of the natural cause, we call it a miracle, as, for
 instance, when anyone is cured of a fever without the operation of
 nature. Therefore the angels and demons can work miracles.
"," Further, superior power is not subject to the order of an
 inferior cause. But corporeal nature is inferior to an angel.
 Therefore an angel can work outside the order of corporeal agents;
 which is to work miracles.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," Some angels are said to work miracles; either because
 God works miracles at their request, in the same way as holy men are
 said to work miracles; or because they exercise a kind of ministry in
 the miracles which take place; as in collecting the dust in the
 general resurrection, or by doing something of that kind.
"," Properly speaking, as said above, miracles are those
 things which are done outside the order of the whole created nature.
 But as we do not know all the power of created nature, it follows
 that when anything is done outside the order of created nature by a
 power unknown to us, it is called a miracle as regards ourselves. So
 when the demons do anything of their own natural power, these things
 are called ""miracles"" not in an absolute sense, but in reference to
 ourselves. In this way the magicians work miracles through the
 demons; and these are said to be done by ""private contracts,""
 forasmuch as every power of the creature, in the universe, may be
 compared to the power of a private person in a city. Hence when a
 magician does anything by compact with the devil, this is done as it
 were by private contract. On the other hand, the Divine justice is in
 the whole universe as the public law is in the city. Therefore good
 Christians, so far as they work miracles by Divine justice, are said
 to work miracles by ""public justice"": but bad Christians by the
 ""signs of public justice,"" as by invoking the name of Christ, or by
 making use of other sacred signs.
"," Spiritual powers are able to effect whatever happens in
 this visible world, by employing corporeal seeds by local movement.
"," Although the angels can do something which is outside
 the order of corporeal nature, yet they cannot do anything outside
 the whole created order, which is essential to a miracle, as above
 explained.

","Whether an Angel Can Enlighten Man?
"," It would seem that an angel cannot enlighten man. For
 man is enlightened by faith; hence Dionysius (Eccl. Hier. iii)
 attributes enlightenment to baptism, as ""the sacrament of faith."" But
 faith is immediately from God, according to Eph. 2:8: ""By grace you
 are saved through faith, and that not of yourselves, for it is the
 gift of God."" Therefore man is not enlightened by an angel; but
 immediately by God.
"," Further, on the words, ""God hath manifested it to them"" (Rom.
 1:19), the gloss observes that ""not only natural reason availed for
 the manifestation of Divine truths to men, but God also revealed them
 by His work,"" that is, by His creature. But both are immediately from
 God--that is, natural reason and the creature. Therefore God
 enlightens man immediately.
"," Further, whoever is enlightened is conscious of being
 enlightened. But man is not conscious of being enlightened by angels.
 Therefore he is not enlightened by them.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Two dispositions concur in the virtue of faith; first,
 the habit of the intellect whereby it is disposed to obey the will
 tending to Divine truth. For the intellect assents to the truth of
 faith, not as convinced by the reason, but as commanded by the will;
 hence Augustine says, ""No one believes except willingly."" In this
 respect faith comes from God alone. Secondly, faith requires that
 what is to be believed be proposed to the believer; which is
 accomplished by man, according to Rom. 10:17, ""Faith cometh by
 hearing""; principally, however, by the angels, by whom Divine things
 are revealed to men. Hence the angels have some part in the
 enlightenment of faith. Moreover, men are enlightened by the angels
 not only concerning what is to be believed; but also as regards what
 is to be done.
"," Natural reason, which is immediately from God, can be
 strengthened by an angel, as we have said above. Again, the more the
 human intellect is strengthened, so much higher an intelligible truth
 can be elicited from the species derived from creatures. Thus man is
 assisted by an angel so that he may obtain from creatures a more
 perfect knowledge of God.
"," Intellectual operation and enlightenment can be
 understood in two ways. First, on the part of the object understood;
 thus whoever understands or is enlightened, knows that he understands
 or is enlightened, because he knows that the object is made known to
 him. Secondly, on the part of the principle; and thus it does not
 follow that whoever understands a truth, knows what the intellect is,
 which is the principle of the intellectual operation. In like manner
 not everyone who is enlightened by an angel, knows that he is
 enlightened by him.

","Whether the Angels Can Change the Will of Man?
"," It would seem that the angels can change the will of
 man. For, upon the text, ""Who maketh His angels spirits and His
 ministers a flame of fire"" (Heb. 1:7), the gloss notes that ""they are
 fire, as being spiritually fervent, and as burning away our vices.""
 This could not be, however, unless they changed the will. Therefore
 the angels can change the will.
"," Further, Bede says (Super Matth. xv, 11), that, ""the devil
 does not send wicked thoughts, but kindles them."" Damascene, however,
 says that he also sends them; for he remarks that ""every malicious
 act and unclean passion is contrived by the demons and put into men""
 (De Fide Orth. ii, 4); in like manner also the good angels introduce
 and kindle good thoughts. But this could only be if they changed the
 will. Therefore the will is changed by them.
"," Further, the angel, as above explained, enlightens the human
 intellect by means of the phantasms. But as the imagination which
 serves the intellect can be changed by an angel, so can the sensitive
 appetite which serves the will, because it also is a faculty using a
 corporeal organ. Therefore as the angel enlightens the mind, so can
 he change the will.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Those who act as God's ministers, either men or angels,
 are said to burn away vices, and to incite to virtue by way of
 persuasion.
"," The demon cannot put thoughts in our minds by causing
 them from within, since the act of the cogitative faculty is subject
 to the will; nevertheless the devil is called the kindler of
 thoughts, inasmuch as he incites to thought, by the desire of the
 things thought of, by way of persuasion, or by rousing the passions.
 Damascene calls this kindling ""a putting in"" because such a work is
 accomplished within. But good thoughts are attributed to a higher
 principle, namely, God, though they may be procured by the ministry
 of the angels.
"," The human intellect in its present state can understand
 only by turning to the phantasms; but the human will can will
 something following the judgment of reason rather than the passion of
 the sensitive appetite. Hence the comparison does not hold.

544,"[I, Q. 111, Art. 3]
","Whether an Angel Can Change Man's Imagination?
"," It would seem that an angel cannot change man's
 imagination. For the phantasy, as is said De Anima iii, is ""a motion
 caused by the sense in act."" But if this motion were caused by an
 angel, it would not be caused by the sense in act. Therefore it is
 contrary to the nature of the phantasy, which is the act of the
 imaginative faculty, to be changed by an angel.
"," Further, since the forms in the imagination are spiritual,
 they are nobler than the forms existing in sensible matter. But an
 angel cannot impress forms upon sensible matter (Q. 110, A. 2).
 Therefore he cannot impress forms on the imagination, and so he
 cannot change it.
"," Further, Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. xii, 12): ""One spirit
 by intermingling with another can communicate his knowledge to the
 other spirit by these images, so that the latter either understands
 it himself, or accepts it as understood by the other."" But it does
 not seem that an angel can be mingled with the human imagination, nor
 that the imagination can receive the knowledge of an angel. Therefore
 it seems that an angel cannot change the imagination.
"," Further, in the imaginative vision man cleaves to the
 similitudes of the things as to the things themselves. But in this
 there is deception. So as a good angel cannot be the cause of
 deception, it seems that he cannot cause the imaginative vision, by
 changing the imagination.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," The first principle of the imagination is from the
 sense in act. For we cannot imagine what we have never perceived by
 the senses, either wholly or partly; as a man born blind cannot
 imagine color. Sometimes, however, the imagination is informed in
 such a way that the act of the imaginative movement arises from the
 impressions preserved within.
"," An angel changes the imagination, not indeed by the
 impression of an imaginative form in no way previously received from
 the senses (for he cannot make a man born blind imagine color), but
 by local movement of the spirits and humors, as above explained.
"," The commingling of the angelic spirit with the human
 imagination is not a mingling of essences, but by reason of an effect
 which he produces in the imagination in the way above stated; so that
 he shows man what he [the angel] knows, but not in the way he knows.
"," An angel causing an imaginative vision, sometimes
 enlightens the intellect at the same time, so that it knows what
 these images signify; and then there is no deception. But sometimes
 by the angelic operation the similitudes of things only appear in the
 imagination; but neither then is deception caused by the angel, but
 by the defect in the intellect to whom such things appear. Thus
 neither was Christ a cause of deception when He spoke many things to
 the people in parables, which He did not explain to them.

","Whether an Angel Can Change the Human Senses?

 For the sensitive operation is a vital operation. But such an
 operation does not come from an extrinsic principle. Therefore the
 sensitive operation cannot be caused by an angel.
"," Further, the sensitive operation is nobler than the
 nutritive. But the angel cannot change the nutritive power, nor other
 natural forms. Therefore neither can he change the sensitive power.
"," Further, the senses are naturally moved by the sensible

 power, and also of the appetitive and sensitive power, and of any
 other power using a corporeal organ.

 creatures; but he can outside some particular order of nature, since
 he is not subject to that order; thus in some special way an angel

","Whether the Angels Are Sent on Works of Ministry?
"," It would seem that the angels are not sent on works of
 ministry. For every mission is to some determinate place. But
 intellectual actions do not determine a place, for intellect
 abstracts from the ""here"" and ""now."" Since therefore the angelic
 actions are intellectual, it appears that the angels are not sent to
 perform their own actions.
"," Further, the empyrean heaven is the place that beseems the
 angelic dignity. Therefore if they are sent to us in ministry, it
 seems that something of their dignity would be lost; which is
 unseemly.
"," Further, external occupation hinders the contemplation of
 wisdom; hence it is said: ""He that is less in action, shall receive
 wisdom"" (Ecclus. 38:25). So if some angels are sent on external
 ministrations, they would seemingly be hindered from contemplation.
 But the whole of their beatitude consists in the contemplation of
 God. So if they were sent, their beatitude would be lessened; which
 is unfitting.
"," Further, to minister is the part of an inferior; hence it is
 written (Luke 22:27): ""Which is the greater, he that sitteth at
 table, or he that serveth? is not he that sitteth at table?"" But the
 angels are naturally greater than we are. Therefore they are not sent
 to administer to us.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," An operation can be intellectual in two ways. In one
 way, as dwelling in the intellect itself, as contemplation; such an
 operation does not demand to occupy a place; indeed, as Augustine
 says (De Trin. iv, 20): ""Even we ourselves as mentally tasting
 something eternal, are not in this world."" In another sense an action
 is said to be intellectual because it is regulated and commanded by
 some intellect; in that sense the intellectual operations evidently
 have sometimes a determinate place.
"," The empyrean heaven belongs to the angelic dignity by
 way of congruity; forasmuch as it is congruous that the higher body
 should be attributed to that nature which occupies a rank above
 bodies. Yet an angel does not derive his dignity from the empyrean
 heaven; so when he is not actually in the empyrean heaven, nothing of
 his dignity is lost, as neither does a king lessen his dignity when
 not actually sitting on his regal throne, which suits his dignity.
"," In ourselves the purity of contemplation is obscured by
 exterior occupation; because we give ourselves to action through the
 sensitive faculties, the action of which when intense impedes the
 action of the intellectual powers. An angel, on the contrary,
 regulates his exterior actions by intellectual operation alone. Hence
 it follows that his external occupations in no respect impede his
 contemplation; because given two actions, one of which is the rule
 and the reason of the other, one does not hinder but helps the other.
 Wherefore Gregory says (Moral. ii) that ""the angels do not go abroad
 in such a manner as to lose the delights of inward contemplation.""
"," In their external actions the angels chiefly minister
 to God, and secondarily to us; not because we are superior to them,
 absolutely speaking, but because, since every man or angel by
 cleaving to God is made one spirit with God, he is thereby superior
 to every creature. Hence the Apostle says (Phil. 2:3): ""Esteeming
 others better than themselves.""

","Whether All the Angels Are Sent in Ministry?
"," It would seem that all the angels are sent in ministry.
 For the Apostle says (Heb. 1:14): ""All are ministering spirits, sent
 to minister"" [Vulg. 'Are they not all . . . ?'].
"," Further, among the orders, the highest is that of the
 Seraphim, as stated above (Q. 108, A. 6). But a Seraph was sent to
 purify the lips of the prophet (Isa. 6:6, 7). Therefore much more are
 the inferior orders sent.
"," Further, the Divine Persons infinitely excel all the angelic
 orders. But the Divine Persons are sent. Therefore much more are even
 the highest angels sent.
"," Further, if the superior angels are not sent to the external
 ministries, this can only be because the superior angels execute the
 Divine ministries by means of the inferior angels. But as all the
 angels are unequal, as stated above (Q. 50, A. 4), each angel has an
 angel inferior to himself except the last one. Therefore only the
 last angel would be sent in ministry; which contradicts the words,
 ""Thousands of thousands ministered to Him"" (Dan. 7:10).
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," According to Dionysius (Coel. Hier. xiii), the angel
 who was sent to purify the prophet's lips was one of the inferior
 order; but was called a ""Seraph,"" that is, ""kindling "" in an
 equivocal sense, because he came to ""kindle"" the lips of the prophet.
 It may also be said that the superior angels communicate their own
 proper gifts whereby they are denominated, through the ministry of
 the inferior angels. Thus one of the Seraphim is described as
 purifying by fire the prophet's lips, not as if he did so
 immediately, but because an inferior angel did so by his power; as
 the Pope is said to absolve a man when he gives absolution by means
 of someone else.
"," The Divine Persons are not sent in ministry, but are
 said to be sent in an equivocal sense, as appears from what has been
 said (Q. 43, A. 1).
"," A manifold grade exists in the Divine ministries. Hence
 there is nothing to prevent angels though unequal from being sent
 immediately in ministry, in such a manner however that the superior
 are sent to the higher ministries, and the lower to the inferior
 ministries.

548,"[I, Q. 112, Art. 3]
","Whether All the Angels Who Are Sent, Assist?
"," It would seem that the angels who are sent also assist.
 For Gregory says (Hom. xxxiv in Evang.): ""So the angels are sent, and
 assist; for, though the angelic spirit is limited, yet the supreme
 Spirit, God, is not limited.""
"," Further, the angel was sent to administer to Tobias. Yet he
 said, ""I am the angel Raphael, one of the seven who stand before the
 Lord"" (Tob. 12:15). Therefore the angels who are sent, assist.
"," Further, every holy angel is nearer to God than Satan is. Yet
 Satan assisted God, according to Job 1:6: ""When the sons of God came
 to stand before the Lord, Satan also was present among them.""
 Therefore much more do the angels, who are sent to minister, assist.
"," Further, if the inferior angels do not assist, the reason is
 because they receive the Divine enlightenment, not immediately, but
 through the superior angels. But every angel receives the Divine
 enlightenment from a superior, except the one who is highest of all.
 Therefore only the highest angel would assist; which is contrary to
 the text of Dan. 7:10: ""Ten thousand times a hundred thousand stood
 before Him."" Therefore the angels who are sent also assist.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," Satan is not described as having assisted, but as
 present among the assistants; for, as Gregory says (Moral. ii),
 ""though he has lost beatitude, still he has retained a nature like to
 the angels.""
"," All the assistants see some things immediately in the
 glory of the Divine Essence; and so it may be said that it is the
 prerogative of the whole of the highest hierarchy to be immediately
 enlightened by God; while the higher ones among them see more than is
 seen by the inferior; some of whom enlighten others: as also among
 those who assist the king, one knows more of the king's secrets than
 another.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
549,"[I, Q. 112, Art. 4]
","Whether All the Angels of the Second Hierarchy Are Sent?
"," It would seem that all the angels of the second
 hierarchy are sent. For all the angels either assist, or minister,
 according to Dan. 7:10. But the angels of the second hierarchy do
 not assist; for they are enlightened by the angels of the first
 hierarchy, as Dionysius says (Coel. Hier. viii). Therefore all the
 angels of the second hierarchy are sent in ministry.
"," Further, Gregory says (Moral. xvii) that ""there are more who
 minister than who assist."" This would not be the case if the angels
 of the second hierarchy were not sent in ministry. Therefore all the
 angels of the second hierarchy are sent to minister.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The Dominations are reckoned among the ministering
 angels, not as exercising but as disposing and commanding what is to
 be done by others; thus an architect does not put his hands to the
 production of his art, but only disposes and orders what others are
 to do.
"," A twofold reason may be given in assigning the number
 of the assisting and ministering angels. For Gregory says that those
 who minister are more numerous than those who assist; because he
 takes the words (Dan. 7:10) ""thousands of thousands ministered to
 Him,"" not in a multiple but in a partitive sense, to mean ""thousands
 out of thousands""; thus the number of those who minister is
 indefinite, and signifies excess; while the number of assistants is
 finite as in the words added, ""and ten thousand times a hundred
 thousand assisted Him."" This explanation rests on the opinion of the
 Platonists, who said that the nearer things are to the one first
 principle, the smaller they are in number; as the nearer a number is
 to unity, the lesser it is than multitude. This opinion is verified
 as regards the number of orders, as six administer and three assist.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
550,"[I, Q. 113, Art. 1]
","Whether Men Are Guarded by the Angels?
"," It would seem that men are not guarded by the angels.
 For guardians are deputed to some because they either know not how,
 or are not able, to guard themselves, as children and the sick. But
 man is able to guard himself by his free-will; and knows how by his
 natural knowledge of natural law. Therefore man is not guarded by an
 angel.
"," Further, a strong guard makes a weaker one superfluous. But
 men are guarded by God, according to Ps. 120:4: ""He shall neither
 slumber nor sleep, that keepeth Israel."" Therefore man does not need
 to be guarded by an angel.
"," Further, the loss of the guarded redounds to the negligence
 of the guardian; hence it was said to a certain one: ""Keep this man;
 and if he shall slip away, thy life shall be for his life"" (3 Kings
 20:39). Now many perish daily through falling into sin; whom the
 angels could help by visible appearance, or by miracles, or in some
 such-like way. The angels would therefore be negligent if men are
 given to their guardianship. But that is clearly false. Therefore
 the angels are not the guardians of men.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," By free-will man can avoid evil to a certain degree,
 but not in any sufficient degree; forasmuch as he is weak in
 affection towards good on account of the manifold passions of the
 soul. Likewise universal natural knowledge of the law, which by
 nature belongs to man, to a certain degree directs man to good, but
 not in a sufficient degree; because in the application of the
 universal principles of law to particular actions man happens to be
 deficient in many ways. Hence it is written (Wis. 9:14): ""The
 thoughts of mortal men are fearful, and our counsels uncertain.""
 Thus man needs to be guarded by the angels.
"," Two things are required for a good action; first, that
 the affection be inclined to good, which is effected in us by the
 habit of mortal virtue. Secondly, that reason should discover the
 proper methods to make perfect the good of virtue; this the
 Philosopher (Ethic. vi) attributes to prudence. As regards the first,
 God guards man immediately by infusing into him grace and virtues; as
 regards the second, God guards man as his universal instructor, Whose
 precepts reach man by the medium of the angels, as above stated (Q.
 111, A. 1).
"," As men depart from the natural instinct of good by
 reason of a sinful passion, so also do they depart from the
 instigation of the good angels, which takes place invisibly when they
 enlighten man that he may do what is right. Hence that men perish is
 not to be imputed to the negligence of the angels but to the malice
 of men. That they sometimes appear to men visibly outside the
 ordinary course of nature comes from a special grace of God, as
 likewise that miracles occur outside the order of nature.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
551,"[I, Q. 113, Art. 2]
","Whether Each Man Is Guarded by an Angel?
"," It would seem that each man is not guarded by an angel.
 For an angel is stronger than a man. But one man suffices to guard
 many men. Therefore much more can one angel guard many men.
"," Further, the lower things are brought to God through the
 medium of the higher, as Dionysius says (Coel. Hier. iv, xiii). But
 as all the angels are unequal (Q. 50, A. 4), there is only one angel
 between whom and men there is no medium. Therefore there is only one
 angel who immediately keeps men.
"," Further, the greater angels are deputed to the greater
 offices. But it is not a greater office to keep one man more than
 another; since all men are naturally equal. Since therefore of all
 the angels one is greater than another, as Dionysius says (Coel.
 Hier. x), it seems that different men are not guarded by different
 angels.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," A guardian may be assigned to a man for two reasons:
 first, inasmuch as a man is an individual, and thus to one man one
 guardian is due; and sometimes several are appointed to guard one.
 Secondly, inasmuch as a man is part of a community, and thus one man
 is appointed as guardian of a whole community; to whom it belongs to
 provide what concerns one man in his relation to the whole community,
 such as external works, which are sources of strength or weakness to
 others. But angel guardians are given to men also as regards
 invisible and occult things, concerning the salvation of each one in
 his own regard. Hence individual angels are appointed to guard
 individual men.
"," As above stated (Q. 112, A. 3, ad 4), all the angels of
 the first hierarchy are, as to some things, enlightened by God
 directly; but as to other things, only the superior are directly
 enlightened by God, and these reveal them to the inferior. And the
 same also applies to the inferior orders: for a lower angel is
 enlightened in some respects by one of the highest, and in other
 respects by the one immediately above him. Thus it is possible that
 some one angel enlightens a man immediately, and yet has other angels
 beneath him whom he enlightens.
"," Although men are equal in nature, still inequality
 exists among them, according as Divine Providence orders some to the
 greater, and others to the lesser things, according to Ecclus. 33:11,
 12: ""With much knowledge the Lord hath divided them, and diversified
 their ways: some of them hath He blessed and exalted, and some of
 them hath He cursed and brought low."" Thus it is a greater office to
 guard one man than another.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
552,"[I, Q. 113, Art. 3]
","Whether to Guard Men Belongs Only to the Lowest Order of Angels?
"," It would seem that the guardianship of men does not
 belong only to the lowest order of the angels. For Chrysostom says
 that the text (Matt. 18:10), ""Their angels in heaven,"" etc. is to be
 understood not of any angels but of the highest. Therefore the
 superior angels guard men.
"," Further, the Apostle says that angels ""are sent to
 minister for them who shall receive the inheritance of salvation""
 (Heb. 1:14); and thus it seems that the mission of the angels is
 directed to the guardianship of men. But five orders are sent in
 external ministry (Q. 112, A. 4). Therefore all the angels of the
 five orders are deputed to the guardianship of men.
"," Further, for the guardianship of men it seems especially
 necessary to coerce the demons, which belongs most of all to the
 Powers, according to Gregory (Hom. xxxiv in Evang.); and to work
 miracles, which belongs to the Virtues. Therefore these orders are
 also deputed to the work of guardianship, and not only the lowest
 order.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Chrysostom can be taken to mean the highest in the
 lowest order of angels; for, as Dionysius says (Coel. Hier. x) in
 each order there are first, middle, and last. It is, however,
 probable that the greater angels are deputed to keep those chosen by
 God for the higher degree of glory.
"," Not all the angels who are sent have guardianship of
 individual men; but some orders have a universal guardianship,
 greater or less, as above explained.
"," Even inferior angels exercise the office of the
 superior, as they share in their gifts, and they are executors of the
 superiors' power; and in this way all the angels of the lowest order
 can coerce the demons, and work miracles.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
553,"[I, Q. 113, Art. 4]
","Whether Angels Are Appointed to the Guardianship of All Men?
"," It would seem that angels are not appointed to the
 guardianship of all men. For it is written of Christ (Phil. 2:7) that
 ""He was made in the likeness of men, and in habit found as a man."" If
 therefore angels are appointed to the guardianship of all men, Christ
 also would have had an angel guardian. But this is unseemly, for
 Christ is greater than all the angels. Therefore angels are not
 appointed to the guardianship of all men.
"," Further, Adam was the first of all men. But it was not
 fitting that he should have an angel guardian, at least in the state
 of innocence: for then he was not beset by any dangers. Therefore
 angels are not appointed to the guardianship of all men.
"," Further, angels are appointed to the guardianship of men,
 that they may take them by the hand and guide them to eternal life,
 encourage them to good works, and protect them against the assaults
 of the demons. But men who are foreknown to damnation, never attain
 to eternal life. Infidels, also, though at times they perform good
 works, do not perform them well, for they have not a right intention:
 for ""faith directs the intention"" as Augustine says (Enarr. ii in Ps.
 31). Moreover, the coming of Antichrist will be ""according to the
 working of Satan,"" as it is written (2 Thess. 2:9). Therefore angels
 are not deputed to the guardianship of all men.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Christ as man was guided immediately by the Word of
 God: wherefore He needed not be guarded by an angel. Again as regards
 His soul, He was a comprehensor, although in regard to His passible
 body, He was a wayfarer. In this latter respect it was right that He
 should have not a guardian angel as superior to Him, but a
 ministering angel as inferior to Him. Whence it is written (Matt.
 4:11) that ""angels came and ministered to Him.""
"," In the state of innocence man was not threatened
 by any peril from within: because within him all was well ordered, as
 we have said above (Q. 95, AA. 1, 3). But peril threatened from
 without on account of the snares of the demons; as was proved by the
 event. For this reason he needed a guardian angel.
"," Just as the foreknown, the infidels, and even
 Antichrist, are not deprived of the interior help of natural reason;
 so neither are they deprived of that exterior help granted by God to
 the whole human race--namely the guardianship of the angels. And
 although the help which they receive therefrom does not result in
 their deserving eternal life by good works, it does nevertheless
 conduce to their being protected from certain evils which would hurt
 both themselves and others. For even the demons are held off by the
 good angels, lest they hurt as much as they would. In like manner
 Antichrist will not do as much harm as he would wish.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
554,"[I, Q. 113, Art. 5]
","Whether an Angel Is Appointed to Guard a Man from His Birth?
"," It would seem that an angel is not appointed to guard
 a man from his birth. For angels are ""sent to minister for them who
 shall receive the inheritance of salvation,"" as the Apostle says
 (Heb. 1:14). But men begin to receive the inheritance of salvation,
 when they are baptized. Therefore an angel is appointed to guard a
 man from the time of his baptism, not of his birth.
"," Further, men are guarded by angels in as far as angels
 enlighten and instruct them. But children are not capable of
 instruction as soon as they are born, for they have not the use of
 reason. Therefore angels are not appointed to guard children as
 soon as they are born.
"," Further, a child has a rational soul for some time before
 birth, just as well as after. But it does not appear that an angel is
 appointed to guard a child before its birth, for they are not then
 admitted to the sacraments of the Church. Therefore angels are not
 appointed to guard men from the moment of their birth.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Angels are sent to minister, and that efficaciously
 indeed, for those who shall receive the inheritance of salvation, if
 we consider the ultimate effect of their guardianship, which is the
 realizing of that inheritance. But for all that, the angelic
 ministrations are not withdrawn for others although they are not so
 efficacious as to bring them to salvation: efficacious, nevertheless,
 they are, inasmuch as they ward off many evils.
"," Guardianship is ordained to enlightenment by
 instruction, as to its ultimate and principal effect. Nevertheless it
 has many other effects consistent with childhood; for instance to
 ward off the demons, and to prevent both bodily and spiritual harm.
"," As long as the child is in the mother's womb it is not
 entirely separate, but by reason of a certain intimate tie, is still
 part of her: just as the fruit while hanging on the tree is part of
 the tree. And therefore it can be said with some degree of
 probability, that the angel who guards the mother guards the child
 while in the womb. But at its birth, when it becomes separate from
 the mother, an angel guardian is appointed to it; as Jerome, above
 quoted, says.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
555,"[I, Q. 113, Art. 6]
","Whether the Angel Guardian Ever Forsakes a Man?
"," It would seem that the angel guardian sometimes forsakes
 the man whom he is appointed to guard. For it is said (Jer. 51:9) in
 the person of the angels: ""We would have cured Babylon, but she is not
 healed: let us forsake her."" And (Isa. 5:5) it is written: ""I will
 take away the hedge""--that is, ""the guardianship of the angels""
 [gloss]--""and it shall be wasted.""
"," Further, God's guardianship excels that of the angels. But
 God forsakes man at times, according to Ps. 21:2: ""O God, my God,
 look upon me: why hast Thou forsaken me?"" Much rather therefore does
 an angel guardian forsake man.
"," Further, according to Damascene (De Fide Orth. ii, 3), ""When
 the angels are here with us, they are not in heaven."" But sometimes
 they are in heaven. Therefore sometimes they forsake us.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Although an angel may forsake a man sometimes locally,
 he does not for that reason forsake him as to the effect of his
 guardianship: for even when he is in heaven he knows what is
 happening to man; nor does he need time for his local motion, for he
 can be with man in an instant.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
556,"[I, Q. 113, Art. 7]
","Whether Angels Grieve for the Ills of Those Whom They Guard?
"," It would seem that angels grieve for the ills of those
 whom they guard. For it is written (Isa. 33:7): ""The angels of peace
 shall weep bitterly."" But weeping is a sign of grief and sorrow.
 Therefore angels grieve for the ills of those whom they guard.
"," Further, according to Augustine (De Civ. Dei xiv, 15),
 ""sorrow is for those things that happen against our will."" But the
 loss of the man whom he has guarded is against the guardian angel's
 will. Therefore angels grieve for the loss of men.
"," Further, as sorrow is contrary to joy, so penance is contrary
 to sin. But angels rejoice about one sinner doing penance, as we are
 told, Luke 15:7. Therefore they grieve for the just man who falls
 into sin.
"," Further, on Numbers 18:12: ""Whatsoever first-fruits they
 offer,"" etc. the gloss of Origen says: ""The angels are brought to
 judgment as to whether men have fallen through their negligence or
 through their own fault."" But it is reasonable for anyone to grieve
 for the ills which have brought him to judgment. Therefore angels
 grieve for men's sins.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," These words of Isaias may be understood of the angels,
 i.e. the messengers, of Ezechias, who wept on account of the words of
 Rabsaces, as related Isa. 37:2 seqq.: this would be the literal
 sense. According to the allegorical sense the ""angels of peace"" are
 the apostles and preachers who weep for men's sins. If according to
 the anagogical sense this passage be expounded of the blessed angels,
 then the expression is metaphorical, and signifies that universally
 speaking the angels will the salvation of mankind: for in this sense
 we attribute passions to God and the angels.
"," Both in man's repentance and in man's sin there is one
 reason for the angel's joy, namely the fulfilment of the ordering of
 the Divine Providence.
"," The angels are brought into judgment for the sins of
 men, not as guilty, but as witnesses to convict man of weakness.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
557,"[I, Q. 113, Art. 8]
","Whether There Can Be Strife or Discord Among the Angels?
"," It would seem that there can be [no] strife or discord among
 the angels. For it is written (Job 25:2): ""Who maketh peace in His
 high places."" But strife is opposed to peace. Therefore among the high
 angels there is no strife.
"," Further, where there is perfect charity and just
 authority there can be no strife. But all this exists among the
 angels. Therefore there is no strife among the angels.
"," Further, if we say that angels strive for those whom they
 guard, one angel must needs take one side, and another angel the
 opposite side. But if one side is in the right the other side is in
 the wrong. It will follow therefore, that a good angel is a compounder
 of wrong; which is unseemly. Therefore there is no strife among good
 angels.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
558,"[I, Q. 114, Art. 1]
","Whether Men Are Assailed by the Demons?
"," It would seem that men are not assailed by the demons.
 For angels are sent by God to guard man. But demons are not sent by
 God: for the demons' intention is the loss of souls; whereas God's is
 the salvation of souls. Therefore demons are not deputed to assail
 man.
"," Further, it is not a fair fight, for the weak to be set
 against the strong, and the ignorant against the astute. But men are
 weak and ignorant, whereas the demons are strong and astute. It is not
 therefore to be permitted by God, the author of all justice, that men
 should be assailed by demons.
"," Further, the assaults of the flesh and the world are
 enough for man's exercise. But God permits His elect to be assailed
 that they may be exercised. Therefore there is no need for them to be
 assailed by the demons.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The wicked angels assail men in two ways. Firstly by
 instigating them to sin; and thus they are not sent by God to assail
 us, but are sometimes permitted to do so according to God's just
 judgments. But sometimes their assault is a punishment to man: and
 thus they are sent by God; as the lying spirit was sent to punish
 Achab, King of Israel, as is related in 3 Kings 22:20. For punishment
 is referred to God as its first author. Nevertheless the demons who
 are sent to punish, do so with an intention other than that for which
 they are sent; for they punish from hatred or envy; whereas they are
 sent by God on account of His justice.
"," In order that the conditions of the fight be not
 unequal, there is as regards man the promised recompense, to be
 gained principally through the grace of God, secondarily through the
 guardianship of the angels. Wherefore (4 Kings 6:16), Eliseus said to
 his servant: ""Fear not, for there are more with us than with them.""
"," The assault of the flesh and the world would suffice
 for the exercise of human weakness: but it does not suffice for the
 demon's malice, which makes use of both the above in assailing men.
 But by the Divine ordinance this tends to the glory of the elect.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
559,"[I, Q. 114, Art. 2]
","Whether to Tempt Is Proper to the Devil?
"," It would seem that to tempt is not proper to the devil.
 For God is said to tempt, according to Gen. 22:1, ""God tempted
 Abraham."" Moreover man is tempted by the flesh and the world. Again,
 man is said to tempt God, and to tempt man. Therefore it is not
 proper to the devil to tempt.
"," Further, to tempt is a sign of ignorance. But the demons know
 what happens among men. Therefore the demons do not tempt.
"," Further, temptation is the road to sin. Now sin dwells in the
 will. Since therefore the demons cannot change man's will, as appears
 from what has been said above (Q. 111, A. 2), it seems that it is not
 in their province to tempt.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The demons know what happens outwardly among men; but
 the inward disposition of man God alone knows, Who is the ""weigher of
 spirits"" (Prov. 16:2). It is this disposition that makes man more
 prone to one vice than to another: hence the devil tempts, in order
 to explore this inward disposition of man, so that he may tempt him
 to that vice to which he is most prone.
"," Although a demon cannot change the will, yet, as stated
 above (Q. 111, A. 3), he can change the inferior powers of man, in a
 certain degree: by which powers, though the will cannot be forced, it
 can nevertheless be inclined.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
560,"[I, Q. 114, Art. 3]
","Whether All Sins Are Due to the Temptation of the Devil?
"," It would seem that all sins are due to the temptation of
 the devil. For Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv) that ""the multitude of
 demons is the cause of all evils, both to themselves and to others.""
 And Damascene says (De Fide Orth. ii, 4) that ""all malice and all
 uncleanness have been devised by the devil.""
"," Further, of every sinner can be said what the Lord said of
 the Jews (John 8:44): ""You are of your father the devil."" But this
 was in as far as they sinned through the devil's instigation.
 Therefore every sin is due to the devil's instigation.
"," Further, as angels are deputed to guard men, so demons are
 deputed to assail men. But every good thing we do is due to the
 suggestion of the good angels: because the Divine gifts are borne
 to us by the angels. Therefore all the evil we do, is due to the
 instigation of the devil.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," When man commits sin without being thereto instigated
 by the devil, he nevertheless becomes a child of the devil thereby,
 in so far as he imitates him who was the first to sin.
"," Man can of his own accord fall into sin: but he cannot
 advance in merit without the Divine assistance, which is borne to man
 by the ministry of the angels. For this reason the angels take part
 in all our good works: whereas all our sins are not due to the
 demons' instigation. Nevertheless there is no kind of sin which is
 not sometimes due to the demons' suggestion.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
561,"[I, Q. 114, Art. 4]
","Whether Demons Can Lead Men Astray by Means of Real Miracles?
"," It would seem that the demons cannot lead men astray by
 means of real miracles. For the activity of the demons will show
 itself especially in the works of Antichrist. But as the Apostle says
 (2 Thess. 2:9), his ""coming is according to the working of Satan, in
 all power, and signs, and lying wonders."" Much more therefore at
 other times do the demons perform lying wonders.
"," Further, true miracles are wrought by some corporeal change.
 But demons are unable to change the nature of a body; for Augustine
 says (De Civ. Dei xviii, 18): ""I cannot believe that the human body
 can receive the limbs of a beast by means of a demon's art or power.""
 Therefore the demons cannot work real miracles.
"," Further, an argument is useless which may prove both ways. If
 therefore real miracles can be wrought by demons, to persuade one of
 what is false, they will be useless to confirm the teaching of the
 faith. This is unfitting; for it is written (Mk. 16:20): ""The Lord
 working withal, and confirming the word with signs that followed.""
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," As Augustine says in the same place, the works of
 Antichrist may be called lying wonders, ""either because he will
 deceive men's senses by means of phantoms, so that he will not really
 do what he will seem to do; or because, if he work real prodigies,
 they will lead those into falsehood who believe in him.""
"," As we have said above (Q. 110, A. 2), corporeal matter
 does not obey either good or bad angels at their will, so that demons
 be able by their power to transmute matter from one form to another;
 but they can employ certain seeds that exist in the elements of the
 world, in order to produce these effects, as Augustine says (De Trin.
 iii, 8, 9). Therefore it must be admitted that all the transformation
 of corporeal things which can be produced by certain natural powers,
 to which we must assign the seeds above mentioned, can alike be
 produced by the operation of the demons, by the employment of these
 seeds; such as the transformation of certain things into serpents or
 frogs, which can be produced by putrefaction. On the contrary, those
 transformations which cannot be produced by the power of nature,
 cannot in reality be effected by the operation of the demons; for
 instance, that the human body be changed into the body of a beast, or
 that the body of a dead man return to life. And if at times something
 of this sort seems to be effected by the operation of demons, it is
 not real but a mere semblance of reality.
"," As Augustine says (QQ. 83, qu. 79): ""When magicians do
 what holy men do, they do it for a different end and by a different
 right. The former do it for their own glory; the latter, for the
 glory of God: the former, by certain private compacts; the latter by
 the evident assistance and command of God, to Whom every creature is
 subject.""

562,"[I, Q. 114, Art. 5]
","Whether a Demon Who Is Overcome by Man, Is for This Reason Hindered
"," It would seem that a demon who is overcome by a man, is
 not for that reason hindered from any further assault. For Christ
 overcame the tempter most effectively. Yet afterwards the demon
 assailed Him by instigating the Jews to kill Him. Therefore it is
 not true that the devil when conquered ceases his assaults.
"," Further, to inflict punishment on one who has been worsted
 in a fight, is to incite him to a sharper attack. But this is not
 befitting God's mercy. Therefore the conquered demons are not
 prevented from further assaults.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
563,"[I, Q. 115, Art. 1]
","Whether a Body Can Be Active?
"," It would seem that no bodies are active. For Augustine
 says (De Civ. Dei v, 9): ""There are things that are acted upon, but
 do not act; such are bodies: there is one Who acts but is not acted
 upon; this is God: there are things that both act and are acted upon;
 these are the spiritual substances.""
"," Further, every agent except the first agent requires in its
 work a subject susceptible of its action. But there is not substance
 below the corporeal substance which can be susceptible of the
 latter's action; since it belongs to the lowest degree of beings.
 Therefore corporeal substance is not active.
"," Further, every corporeal substance is limited by quantity.
 But quantity hinders substance from movement and action, because it
 surrounds it and penetrates it: just as a cloud hinders the air from
 receiving light. A proof of this is that the more a body increases in
 quantity, the heavier it is and the more difficult to move. Therefore
 no corporeal substance is active.
"," Further, the power of action in every agent is according to
 its propinquity to the first active cause. But bodies, being most
 composite, are most remote from the first active cause, which is most
 simple. Therefore no bodies are active.
"," Further, if a body is an agent, the term of its action is
 either a substantial, or an accidental form. But it is not a
 substantial form; for it is not possible to find in a body any
 principle of action, save an active quality, which is an accident;
 and an accident cannot be the cause of a substantial form, since the
 cause is always more excellent than the effect. Likewise, neither is
 it an accidental form, for ""an accident does not extend beyond its
 subject,"" as Augustine says (De Trin. ix, 4). Therefore no bodies are
 active.
",,,,,,,,,,,,," This passage of Augustine is to be understood of the
 whole corporeal nature considered as a whole, which thus has no
 nature inferior to it, on which it can act; as the spiritual nature
 acts on the corporeal, and the uncreated nature on the created.
 Nevertheless one body is inferior to another, forasmuch as it is in
 potentiality to that which the other has in act.
"," Quantity does not entirely hinder the corporeal form
 from action, as stated above; but from being a universal agent,
 forasmuch as a form is individualized through being in matter subject
 to quantity. The proof taken from the weight of bodies is not to the
 purpose. First, because addition of quantity does not cause weight;
 as is proved (De Coelo et Mundo iv, 2). Secondly, it is false that
 weight retards movement; on the contrary, the heavier a thing, the
 greater its movement, if we consider the movement proper thereto.
 Thirdly, because action is not effected by local movement, as
 Democritus held: but by something being reduced from potentiality to
 act.
"," A body is not that which is most distant from God; for
 it participates something of a likeness to the Divine Being,
 forasmuch as it has a form. That which is most distant from God is
 primary matter; which is in no way active, since it is a pure
 potentiality.
"," The term of a body's action is both an accidental form
 and a substantial form. For the active quality, such as heat,
 although itself an accident, acts nevertheless by virtue of the
 substantial form, as its instrument: wherefore its action can
 terminate in a substantial form; thus natural heat, as the instrument
 of the soul, has an action terminating in the generation of flesh.
 But by its own virtue it produces an accident. Nor is it against the
 nature of an accident to surpass its subject in acting, but it is to
 surpass it in being; unless indeed one were to imagine that an
 accident transfers its identical self from the agent to the patient;
 thus Democritus explained action by an issue of atoms.

","Whether There Are Any Seminal Virtues in Corporeal Matter?
"," It would seem that there are no seminal virtues in
 corporeal matter. For virtue (ratio) implies something of a
 spiritual order. But in corporeal matter nothing exists spiritually,
 but only materially, that is, according to the mode of that in which
 it is. Therefore there are no seminal virtues in corporeal matter.
"," Further, Augustine (De Trin. iii, 8, 9) says that demons
 produce certain results by employing with a hidden movement certain
 seeds, which they know to exist in matter. But bodies, not virtues,
 can be employed with local movement. Therefore it is unreasonable to
 say that there are seminal virtues in corporeal matter.
"," Further, seeds are active principles. But there are no active
 principles in corporeal matter; since, as we have said above, matter
 is not competent to act (A. 1, ad 2, 4). Therefore there are no
 seminal virtues in corporeal matter.
"," Further, there are said to be certain ""causal virtues""
 (Augustine, De Gen. ad lit. v, 4) which seem to suffice for the
 production of things. But seminal virtues are not causal virtues: for
 miracles are outside the scope of seminal virtues, but not of causal
 virtues. Therefore it is unreasonable to say that there are seminal
 virtues in corporeal matter.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," These active and passive virtues of natural things,
 though not called ""virtues"" (rationes) by reason of their being in
 corporeal matter, can nevertheless be so called in respect of their
 origin, forasmuch as they are the effect of the typal ideas [rationes
 ideales].
"," These active and passive virtues are in certain parts
 of corporeal things: and when they are employed with local movement
 for the production of certain results, we speak of the demons as
 employing seeds.
"," The seed of the male is the active principle in the
 generation of an animal. But that can be called seed also which the
 female contributes as the passive principle. And thus the word ""seed""
 covers both active and passive principles.
"," From the words of Augustine when speaking of these
 seminal virtues, it is easy to gather that they are also causal
 virtues, just as seed is a kind of cause: for he says (De Trin. iii,
 9) that, ""as a mother is pregnant with the unborn offspring, so is
 the world itself pregnant with the causes of unborn things.""
 Nevertheless, the ""typal ideas"" can be called ""causal virtues,"" but
 not, strictly speaking, ""seminal virtues,"" because seed is not a
 separate principle; and because miracles are not wrought outside the
 scope of causal virtues. Likewise neither are miracles wrought
 outside the scope of the passive virtues so implanted in the
 creature, that the latter can be used to any purpose that God
 commands. But miracles are said to be wrought outside the scope of
 the natural active virtues, and the passive potentialities which are
 ordered to such active virtues, and this is what is meant when we
 say that they are wrought outside the scope of seminal virtues.

565,"[I, Q. 115, Art. 3]
","Whether the Heavenly Bodies Are the Cause of What Is Produced in
"," It would seem that the heavenly bodies are not the cause
 of what is produced in bodies here below. For Damascene says (De Fide
 Orth. ii, 7): ""We say that they""--namely, the heavenly bodies--""are
 not the cause of generation or corruption: they are rather signs of
 storms and atmospheric changes.""
"," Further, for the production of anything, an agent and matter
 suffice. But in things here below there is passive matter; and there
 are contrary agents--heat and cold, and the like. Therefore for the
 production of things here below, there is no need to ascribe
 causality to the heavenly bodies.
"," Further, the agent produces its like. Now it is to be
 observed that everything which is produced here below is produced
 through the action of heat and cold, moisture and dryness, and other
 such qualities, which do not exist in heavenly bodies. Therefore the
 heavenly bodies are not the cause of what is produced here below.
"," Further, Augustine says (De Civ. Dei v, 6): ""Nothing is more
 corporeal than sex."" But sex is not caused by the heavenly bodies: a
 sign of this is that of twins born under the same constellation, one
 may be male, the other female. Therefore the heavenly bodies are not
 the cause of things produced in bodies here below.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," These words of Damascene are to be understood as
 denying that the heavenly bodies are the first cause of generation
 and corruption here below; for this was affirmed by those who held
 that the heavenly bodies are gods.
"," The active principles of bodies here below are only the
 active qualities of the elements, such as hot and cold and the like.
 If therefore the substantial forms of inferior bodies were not
 diversified save according to accidents of that kind, the principles
 of which the early natural philosophers held to be the ""rare"" and the
 ""dense""; there would be no need to suppose some principle above these
 inferior bodies, for they would be of themselves sufficient to act.
 But to anyone who considers the matter aright, it is clear that those
 accidents are merely material dispositions in regard to the
 substantial forms of natural bodies. Now matter is not of itself
 sufficient to act. And therefore it is necessary to suppose some
 active principle above these material dispositions.
"," The heavenly bodies have not a specific likeness to the
 bodies here below. Their likeness consists in this, that by reason of
 their universal power, whatever is generated in inferior bodies, is
 contained in them. In this way also we say that all things are like
 God.
"," The actions of heavenly bodies are variously received
 in inferior bodies, according to the various dispositions of matter.
 Now it happens at times that the matter in the human conception is
 not wholly disposed to the male sex; wherefore it is formed sometimes
 into a male, sometimes into a female. Augustine quotes this as an
 argument against divination by stars: because the effects of the
 stars are varied even in corporeal things, according to the various
 dispositions of matter.
",,,,,,,,,,,,
566,"[I, Q. 115, Art. 4]
","Whether the Heavenly Bodies Are the Cause of Human Actions?
"," It would seem that the heavenly bodies are the cause of
 human actions. For since the heavenly bodies are moved by spiritual
 substances, as stated above (Q. 110, A. 3), they act by virtue
 thereof as their instruments. But those spiritual substances are
 superior to our souls. Therefore it seems that they can cause
 impressions on our souls, and thereby cause human actions.
"," Further, every multiform is reducible to a uniform principle.
 But human actions are various and multiform. Therefore it seems that
 they are reducible to the uniform movements of heavenly bodies, as to
 their principles.
"," Further, astrologers often foretell the truth concerning the
 outcome of wars, and other human actions, of which the intellect and
 will are the principles. But they could not do this by means of the
 heavenly bodies, unless these were the cause of human actions.
 Therefore the heavenly bodies are the cause of human actions.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The spiritual substances, that move the heavenly
 bodies, do indeed act on corporeal things by means of the heavenly
 bodies; but they act immediately on the human intellect by
 enlightening it. On the other hand, they cannot compel the will,
 as stated above (Q. 111, A. 2).
"," Just as the multiformity of corporeal movements is
 reducible to the uniformity of the heavenly movement as to its cause:
 so the multiformity of actions proceeding from the intellect and the
 will is reduced to a uniform principle which is the Divine intellect
 and will.
"," The majority of men follow their passions, which are
 movements of the sensitive appetite, in which movements of the
 heavenly bodies can cooperate: but few are wise enough to resist
 these passions. Consequently astrologers are able to foretell the
 truth in the majority of cases, especially in a general way. But not
 in particular cases; for nothing prevents man resisting his passions
 by his free-will. Wherefore the astrologers themselves are wont to
 say that ""the wise man is stronger than the stars"" [*Ptolemy,
 Centiloquium, prop. 5], forasmuch as, to wit, he conquers his passions.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
567,"[I, Q. 115, Art. 5]
","Whether Heavenly Bodies Can Act on the Demons?
"," It would seem that heavenly bodies can act on the demons.
 For the demons, according to certain phases of the moon, can harass
 men, who on that account are called lunatics, as appears from Matt.
 4:24 and 17:14. But this would not be if they were not subject to the
 heavenly bodies. Therefore the demons are subject to them.
"," Further, necromancers observe certain constellations in order
 to invoke the demons. But these would not be invoked through the
 heavenly bodies unless they were subject to them. Therefore they are
 subject to them.
"," Further, heavenly bodies are more powerful than inferior
 bodies. But the demons are confined to certain inferior bodies,
 namely, ""herbs, stones, animals, and to certain sounds and words,
 forms and figures,"" as Porphyry says, quoted by Augustine (De Civ.
 Dei x, 11). Much more therefore are the demons subject to the action
 of heavenly bodies.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," That demons harass men, according to certain phases
 of the moon, happens in two ways. Firstly, they do so in order to
 ""defame God's creature,"" namely, the moon; as Jerome (In Matt. iv,
 24) and Chrysostom (Hom. lvii in Matt.) say. Secondly, because as
 they are unable to effect anything save by means of the natural
 forces, as stated above (Q. 114, A. 4, ad 2) they take into account
 the aptitude of bodies for the intended result. Now it is manifest
 that ""the brain is the most moist of all the parts of the body,"" as
 Aristotle says [*De Part. Animal. ii, 7: De Sens. et Sensato ii: De
 Somn. et Vigil. iii]: wherefore it is the most subject to the action
 of the moon, the property of which is to move what is moist. And it
 is precisely in the brain that animal forces culminate: wherefore
 the demons, according to certain phases of the moon, disturb man's
 imagination, when they observe that the brain is thereto disposed.
"," Demons when summoned through certain constellations,
 come for two reasons. Firstly, in order to lead man into the error
 of believing that there is some Divine power in the stars. Secondly,
 because they consider that under certain constellations corporeal
 matter is better disposed for the result for which they are summoned.
"," As Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xxi, 6), the ""demons are
 enticed through various kinds of stones, herbs, trees, animals,
 songs, rites, not as an animal is enticed by food, but as a spirit by
 signs""; that is to say, forasmuch as these things are offered to them
 in token of the honor due to God, of which they are covetous.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
568,"[I, Q. 115, Art. 6]
","Whether Heavenly Bodies Impose Necessity on Things Subject to Their
"," It would seem that heavenly bodies impose necessity on
 things subject to their action. For given a sufficient cause, the
 effect follows of necessity. But heavenly bodies are a sufficient
 cause of their effects. Since, therefore, heavenly bodies, with their
 movements and dispositions, are necessary beings; it seems that their
 effects follow of necessity.
"," Further, an agent's effect results of necessity in matter,
 when the power of the agent is such that it can subject the matter to
 itself entirely. But the entire matter of inferior bodies is subject
 to the power of heavenly bodies, since this is a higher power than
 theirs. Therefore the effect of the heavenly bodies is of necessity
 received in corporeal matter.
"," Further, if the effect of the heavenly body does not follow
 of necessity, this is due to some hindering cause. But any corporeal
 cause, that might possibly hinder the effect of a heavenly body, must
 of necessity be reducible to some heavenly principle: since the
 heavenly bodies are the causes of all that takes place here below.
 Therefore, since also that heavenly principle is necessary, it
 follows that the effect of the heavenly body is necessarily hindered.
 Consequently it would follow that all that takes place here below
 happens of necessity.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The heavenly bodies are causes of effects that take
 place here below, through the means of particular inferior causes,
 which can fail in their effects in the minority of cases.
"," The power of a heavenly body is not infinite. Wherefore
 it requires a determinate disposition in matter, both as to local
 distance and as to other conditions, in order to produce its effect.
 Therefore as local distance hinders the effect of a heavenly body
 (for the sun has not the same effect in heat in Dacia as in
 Ethiopia); so the grossness of matter, its low or high temperature or
 other such disposition, can hinder the effect of a heavenly body.
"," Although the cause that hinders the effect of another
 cause can be reduced to a heavenly body as its cause; nevertheless
 the clashing of two causes, being accidental, is not reduced to the
 causality of a heavenly body, as stated above.

569,"[I, Q. 116, Art. 1]
","Whether There Be Such a Thing As Fate?
"," It would seem that fate is nothing. For Gregory says in a
 homily for the Epiphany (Hom. x in Evang.): ""Far be it from the hearts
 of the faithful to think that fate is anything real.""
"," Further, what happens by fate is not unforeseen, for as
 Augustine says (De Civ. Dei v, 4), ""fate is understood to be derived
 from the verb 'fari' which means to speak""; as though things were said
 to happen by fate, which are ""fore-spoken"" by one who decrees them to
 happen. Now what is foreseen is neither lucky nor chance-like. If
 therefore things happen by fate, there will be neither luck nor chance
 in the world.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Nothing hinders certain things happening by luck or by
 chance, if compared to their proximate causes: but not if compared to
 Divine Providence, whereby ""nothing happens at random in the world,""
 as Augustine says (QQ. 83, qu. 24).
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
570,"[I, Q. 116, Art. 2]
","Whether Fate Is in Created Things?
"," It would seem that fate is not in created things. For
 Augustine says (De Civ. Dei v, 1) that the ""Divine will or power is
 called fate."" But the Divine will or power is not in creatures, but
 in God. Therefore fate is not in creatures but in God.
"," Further, fate is compared to things that happen by fate, as
 their cause; as the very use of the word proves. But the universal
 cause that of itself effects what takes place by accident here below,
 is God alone, as stated above (A. 1). Therefore fate is in God, and
 not in creatures.
"," Further, if fate is in creatures, it is either a substance or
 an accident: and whichever it is it must be multiplied according to
 the number of creatures. Since, therefore, fate seems to be one thing
 only, it seems that fate is not in creatures, but in God.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The ordering itself of second causes, which Augustine
 (De Civ. Dei v, 8) calls the ""series of causes,"" has not the nature
 of fate, except as dependent on God. Wherefore the Divine power or
 will can be called fate, as being the cause of fate. But essentially
 fate is the very disposition or ""series,"" i.e. order, of second
 causes.
"," Fate has the nature of a cause, just as much as the
 second causes themselves, the ordering of which is called fate.
"," Fate is called a disposition, not that disposition
 which is a species of quality, but in the sense in which it signifies
 order, which is not a substance, but a relation. And if this order be
 considered in relation to its principle, it is one; and thus fate is
 one. But if it be considered in relation to its effects, or to the
 mediate causes, this fate is multiple. In this sense the poet wrote:
 ""Thy fate draws thee.""
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
571,"[I, Q. 116, Art. 3]
","Whether Fate Is Unchangeable?
"," It seems that fate is not unchangeable. For Boethius says
 (De Consol. iv): ""As reasoning is to the intellect, as the begotten is
 to that which is, as time to eternity, as the circle to its centre; so
 is the fickle chain of fate to the unwavering simplicity of
 Providence.""
"," Further, the Philosopher says (Topic. ii, 7): ""If we be
 moved, what is in us is moved."" But fate is a ""disposition inherent
 to changeable things,"" as Boethius says (De Consol. iv). Therefore
 fate is changeable.
"," Further, if fate is unchangeable, what is subject to fate
 happens unchangeably and of necessity. But things ascribed to fate
 seem principally to be contingencies. Therefore there would be no
 contingencies in the world, but all things would happen of necessity.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
572,"[I, Q. 116, Art. 4]
","Whether All Things Are Subject to Fate?
"," It seems that all things are subject to fate. For
 Boethius says (De Consol. iv): ""The chain of fate moves the heaven
 and the stars, tempers the elements to one another, and models them
 by a reciprocal transformation. By fate all things that are born
 into the world and perish are renewed in a uniform progression of
 offspring and seed."" Nothing therefore seems to be excluded from
 the domain of fate.
"," Further, Augustine says (De Civ. Dei v, 1) that fate is
 something real, as referred to the Divine will and power. But the
 Divine will is cause of all things that happen, as Augustine says
 (De Trin. iii, 1 seqq.). Therefore all things are subject to fate.
"," Further, Boethius says (De Consol. iv) that fate ""is a
 disposition inherent to changeable things."" But all creatures are
 changeable, and God alone is truly unchangeable, as stated above
 (Q. 9, A. 2). Therefore fate is in all things.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," All the things mentioned in this passage are done by
 God by means of second causes; for this reason they are contained in
 the order of fate. But it is not the same with everything else, as
 stated above.
"," Fate is to be referred to the Divine will and power, as
 to its first principle. Consequently it does not follow that whatever
 is subject to the Divine will or power, is subject also to fate, as
 already stated.
"," Although all creatures are in some way changeable, yet
 some of them do not proceed from changeable created causes. And
 these, therefore, are not subject to fate, as stated above.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
573,"[I, Q. 117, Art. 1]
","Whether One Man Can Teach Another?
"," It would seem that one man cannot teach another. For the
 Lord says (Matt. 22:8): ""Be not you called Rabbi"": on which the gloss
 of Jerome says, ""Lest you give to men the honor due to God.""
 Therefore to be a master is properly an honor due to God. But it
 belongs to a master to teach. Therefore man cannot teach, and this is
 proper to God.
"," Further, if one man teaches another this is only inasmuch as
 he acts through his own knowledge, so as to cause knowledge in the
 other. But a quality through which anyone acts so as to produce his
 like, is an active quality. Therefore it follows that knowledge is an
 active quality just as heat is.
"," Further, for knowledge we require intellectual light, and the
 species of the thing understood. But a man cannot cause either of
 these in another man. Therefore a man cannot by teaching cause
 knowledge in another man.
"," Further, the teacher does nothing in regard to a disciple
 save to propose to him certain signs, so as to signify something by
 words or gestures. But it is not possible to teach anyone so as to
 cause knowledge in him, by putting signs before him. For these are
 signs either of things that he knows, or of things he does not know.
 If of things that he knows, he to whom these signs are proposed is
 already in the possession of knowledge, and does not acquire it from
 the master. If they are signs of things that he does not know, he can
 learn nothing therefrom: for instance, if one were to speak Greek to
 a man who only knows Latin, he would learn nothing thereby. Therefore
 in no way can a man cause knowledge in another by teaching him.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," As stated above, the teacher only brings exterior help
 as the physician who heals: but just as the interior nature is the
 principal cause of the healing, so the interior light of the
 intellect is the principal cause of knowledge. But both of these are
 from God. Therefore as of God is it written: ""Who healeth all thy
 diseases"" (Ps. 102:3); so of Him is it written: ""He that teacheth man
 knowledge"" (Ps. 93:10), inasmuch as ""the light of His countenance is
 signed upon us"" (Ps. 4:7), through which light all things are shown
 to us.
"," As Averroes argues, the teacher does not cause
 knowledge in the disciple after the manner of a natural active cause.
 Wherefore knowledge need not be an active quality: but is the
 principle by which one is directed in teaching, just as art is the
 principle by which one is directed in working.
"," The master does not cause the intellectual light in the
 disciple, nor does he cause the intelligible species directly: but he
 moves the disciple by teaching, so that the latter, by the power of
 his intellect, forms intelligible concepts, the signs of which are
 proposed to him from without.
"," The signs proposed by the master to the disciple are of
 things known in a general and confused manner; but not known in
 detail and distinctly. Therefore when anyone acquires knowledge by
 himself, he cannot be called self-taught, or be said to have his own
 master because perfect knowledge did not precede in him, such as is
 required in a master.
",,,,,,,,,,,,
574,"[I, Q. 117, Art. 2]
","Whether Man Can Teach the Angels?
"," It would seem that men teach angels. For the Apostle says
 (Eph. 3:10): ""That the manifold wisdom of God may be made known to the
 principalities and powers in the heavenly places through the Church.""
 But the Church is the union of all the faithful. Therefore some things
 are made known to angels through men.
"," Further, the superior angels, who are enlightened immediately
 concerning Divine things by God, can instruct the inferior angels, as
 stated above (Q. 116, A. 1; Q. 112, A. 3). But some men are
 instructed immediately concerning Divine things by the Word of God;
 as appears principally of the apostles from Heb. 1:1, 2: ""Last of
 all, in these days (God) hath spoken to us by His Son."" Therefore
 some men have been able to teach the angels.
"," Further, the inferior angels are instructed by the superior.
 But some men are higher than some angels; since some men are taken up
 to the highest angelic orders, as Gregory says in a homily (Hom.
 xxxiv in Evang.). Therefore some of the inferior angels can be
 instructed by men concerning Divine things.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," Augustine (Gen. ad lit. v, 19) thus explains this
 passage of the Apostle, who in the preceding verses says: ""To me, the
 least of all the saints, is given this grace . . . to enlighten all
 men, that they may see what is the dispensation of the mystery which
 hath been hidden from eternity in God. Hidden, yet so that the
 multiform wisdom of God was made known to the principalities and
 powers in the heavenly places--that is, through the Church."" As
 though he were to say: This mystery was hidden from men, but not from
 the Church in heaven, which is contained in the principalities and
 powers who knew it ""from all ages, but not before all ages: because
 the Church was at first there, where after the resurrection this
 Church composed of men will be gathered together.""
"," The apostles were instructed immediately by the Word of
 God, not according to His Divinity, but according as He spoke in His
 human nature. Hence the argument does not prove.
"," Certain men in this state of life are greater than
 certain angels, not actually, but virtually; forasmuch as they have
 such great charity that they can merit a higher degree of beatitude
 than that possessed by certain angels. In the same way we might say
 that the seed of a great tree is virtually greater than a small tree,
 though actually it is much smaller.

575,"[I, Q. 117, Art. 3]
","Whether Man by the Power of His Soul Can Change Corporeal Matter?
"," It would seem that man by the power of his soul can
 change corporeal matter. For Gregory says (Dialog. ii, 30): ""Saints
 work miracles sometimes by prayer, sometimes by their power: thus
 Peter, by prayer, raised the dead Tabitha to life, and by his reproof
 delivered to death the lying Ananias and Saphira."" But in the working
 of miracles a change is wrought in corporeal matter. Therefore men,
 by the power of the soul, can change corporeal matter.
"," Further, on these words (Gal. 3:1): ""Who hath bewitched you,
 that you should not obey the truth?"" the gloss says that ""some have
 blazing eyes, who by a single look bewitch others, especially
 children."" But this would not be unless the power of the soul could
 change corporeal matter. Therefore man can change corporeal matter by
 the power of his soul.
"," Further, the human body is nobler than other inferior bodies.
 But by the apprehension of the human soul the human body is changed
 to heat and cold, as appears when a man is angry or afraid: indeed
 this change sometimes goes so far as to bring on sickness and death.
 Much more, then, can the human soul by its power change corporeal
 matter.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," The saints are said to work miracles by the power of
 grace, not of nature. This is clear from what Gregory says in the
 same place: ""Those who are sons of God, in power, as John says--what
 wonder is there that they should work miracles by that power?""
"," Avicenna assigns the cause of bewitchment to the fact
 that corporeal matter has a natural tendency to obey spiritual
 substance rather than natural contrary agents. Therefore when the
 soul is of strong imagination, it can change corporeal matter. This
 he says is the cause of the ""evil eye.""
"," The soul is united to the body as its form; and the
 sensitive appetite, which obeys the reason in a certain way, as
 stated above (Q. 81, A. 3), it is the act of a corporeal organ.
 Therefore at the apprehension of the human soul, the sensitive
 appetite must needs be moved with an accompanying corporeal
 operation. But the apprehension of the human soul does not suffice
 to work a change in exterior bodies, except by means of a change in
 the body united to it, as stated above (ad 2).
",,,,,,,,,,,,,
576,"[I, Q. 117, Art. 4]
","Whether the Separate Human Soul Can Move Bodies at Least Locally?
"," It seems that the separate human soul can move bodies at
 least locally. For a body naturally obeys a spiritual substance as to
 local motion, as stated above (Q. 110, A. 5). But the separate
 soul is a spiritual substance. Therefore it can move exterior bodies
 by its command.
"," Further, in the Itinerary of Clement it is said in the
 narrative of Nicetas to Peter, that Simon Magus, by sorcery retained
 power over the soul of a child that he had slain, and that through
 this soul he worked magical wonders. But this could not have been
 without some corporeal change at least as to place. Therefore, the
 separate soul has the power to move bodies locally.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,," There are certain spiritual substances whose powers are
 not determinate to certain bodies; such are the angels who are
 naturally unfettered by a body; consequently various bodies may obey
 them as to movement. But if the motive power of a separate substance
 is naturally determinate to move a certain body, that substance will
 not be able to move a body of higher degree, but only one of lower
 degree: thus according to philosophers the mover of the lower heaven
 cannot move the higher heaven. Wherefore, since the soul is by its
 nature determinate to move the body of which it is the form, it
 cannot by its natural power move any other body.
"," As Augustine (De Civ. Dei x, 11) and Chrysostom (Hom.
 xxviii in Matt.) say, the demons often pretend to be the souls of the
 dead, in order to confirm the error of heathen superstition. It is
 therefore credible that Simon Magus was deceived by some demon who
 pretended to be the soul of the child whom the magician had slain.

577,"[I, Q. 118, Art. 1]
","Whether the Sensitive Soul Is Transmitted with the Semen?
"," It would seem that the sensitive soul is not transmitted
 with the semen, but created by God. For every perfect substance, not
 composed of matter and form, that begins to exist, acquires existence
 not by generation, but by creation: for nothing is generated save
 from matter. But the sensitive soul is a perfect substance, otherwise
 it could not move the body; and since it is the form of a body, it is
 not composed of matter and form. Therefore it begins to exist not by
 generation but by creation.
"," Further, in living things the principle of generation is the
 generating power; which, since it is one of the powers of the
 vegetative soul, is of a lower order than the sensitive soul. Now
 nothing acts beyond its species. Therefore the sensitive soul cannot
 be caused by the animal's generating power.
"," Further, the generator begets its like: so that the form of
 the generator must be actually in the cause of generation. But
 neither the sensitive soul itself nor any part thereof is actually in
 the semen, for no part of the sensitive soul is elsewhere than in
 some part of the body; while in the semen there is not even a
 particle of the body, because there is not a particle of the body
 which is not made from the semen and by the power thereof. Therefore
 the sensitive soul is not produced through the semen.
"," Further, if there be in the semen any principle productive of
 the sensitive soul, this principle either remains after the animal is
 begotten, or it does not remain. Now it cannot remain. For either it
 would be identified with the sensitive soul of the begotten animal;
 which is impossible, for thus there would be identity between
 begetter and begotten, maker and made: or it would be distinct
 therefrom; and again this is impossible, for it has been proved above
 (Q. 76, A. 4) that in one animal there is but one formal principle,
 which is the soul. If on the other hand the aforesaid principle does
 not remain, this again seems to be impossible: for thus an agent
 would act to its own destruction, which cannot be. Therefore the
 sensitive soul cannot be generated from the semen.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," The sensitive soul is not a perfect self-subsistent
 substance. We have said enough (Q. 25, A. 3) on this point, nor need
 we repeat it here.
"," The generating power begets not only by its own virtue
 but by that of the whole soul, of which it is a power. Therefore the
 generating power of a plant generates a plant, and that of an animal
 begets an animal. For the more perfect the soul is, to so much a more
 perfect effect is its generating power ordained.
"," This active force which is in the semen, and which is
 derived from the soul of the generator, is, as it were, a certain
 movement of this soul itself: nor is it the soul or a part of the
 soul, save virtually; thus the form of a bed is not in the saw or the
 axe, but a certain movement towards that form. Consequently there is
 no need for this active force to have an actual organ; but it is
 based on the (vital) spirit in the semen which is frothy, as is
 attested by its whiteness. In which spirit, moreover, there is a
 certain heat derived from the power of the heavenly bodies, by virtue
 of which the inferior bodies also act towards the production of the
 species as stated above (Q. 115, A. 3, ad 2). And since in this
 (vital) spirit the power of the soul is concurrent with the power of
 a heavenly body, it has been said that ""man and the sun generate
 man."" Moreover, elemental heat is employed instrumentally by the
 soul's power, as also by the nutritive power, as stated (De Anima ii,
 4).
"," In perfect animals, generated by coition, the active
 force is in the semen of the male, as the Philosopher says (De Gener.
 Animal. ii, 3); but the foetal matter is provided by the female. In
 this matter, the vegetative soul exists from the very beginning, not
 as to the second act, but as to the first act, as the sensitive soul
 is in one who sleeps. But as soon as it begins to attract
 nourishment, then it already operates in act. This matter therefore
 is transmuted by the power which is in the semen of the male, until
 it is actually informed by the sensitive soul; not as though the
 force itself which was in the semen becomes the sensitive soul; for
 thus, indeed, the generator and generated would be identical;
 moreover, this would be more like nourishment and growth than
 generation, as the Philosopher says. And after the sensitive soul, by
 the power of the active principle in the semen, has been produced in
 one of the principal parts of the thing generated, then it is that
 the sensitive soul of the offspring begins to work towards the
 perfection of its own body, by nourishment and growth. As to the
 active power which was in the semen, it ceases to exist, when the
 semen is dissolved and the (vital) spirit thereof vanishes. Nor is
 there anything unreasonable in this, because this force is not the
 principal but the instrumental agent; and the movement of an
 instrument ceases when once the effect has been produced.

","Whether the Intellectual Soul Is Produced from the Semen?
"," It would seem that the intellectual soul is produced
 from the semen. For it is written (Gen. 46:26): ""All the souls that
 came out of [Jacob's] thigh, sixty-six."" But nothing is produced from
 the thigh of a man, except from the semen. Therefore the intellectual
 soul is produced from the semen.
"," Further, as shown above (Q. 76, A. 3), the intellectual,
 sensitive, and nutritive souls are, in substance, one soul in man.
 But the sensitive soul in man is generated from the semen, as in
 other animals; wherefore the Philosopher says (De Gener. Animal. ii,
 3) that the animal and the man are not made at the same time, but
 first of all the animal is made having a sensitive soul. Therefore
 also the intellectual soul is produced from the semen.
"," Further, it is one and the same agent whose action is
 directed to the matter and to the form: else from the matter and
 the form there would not result something simply one. But the
 intellectual soul is the form of the human body, which is produced
 by the power of the semen. Therefore the intellectual soul also is
 produced by the power of the semen.
"," Further, man begets his like in species. But the human
 species is constituted by the rational soul. Therefore the rational
 soul is from the begetter.
"," Further, it cannot be said that God concurs in sin. But if
 the rational soul be created by God, sometimes God concurs in the
 sin of adultery, since sometimes offspring is begotten of illicit
 intercourse. Therefore the rational soul is not created by God.
",,,,,,,,,,,,," In the passage quoted, the part is put instead of the
 whole, the soul for the whole man, by the figure of synecdoche.
"," Some say that the vital functions observed in the
 embryo are not from its soul, but from the soul of the mother; or
 from the formative power of the semen. Both of these explanations are
 false; for vital functions such as feeling, nourishment, and growth
 cannot be from an extrinsic principle. Consequently it must be said
 that the soul is in the embryo; the nutritive soul from the
 beginning, then the sensitive, lastly the intellectual soul.
"," This argument holds in the case of diverse agents not
 ordered to one another. But where there are many agents ordered to
 one another, nothing hinders the power of the higher agent from
 reaching to the ultimate form; while the powers of the inferior
 agents extend only to some disposition of matter: thus in the
 generation of an animal, the seminal power disposes the matter, but
 the power of the soul gives the form. Now it is manifest from what
 has been said above (Q. 105, A. 5; Q. 110, A. 1) that the whole of
 corporeal nature acts as the instrument of a spiritual power,
 especially of God. Therefore nothing hinders the formation of the
 body from being due to a corporeal power, while the intellectual soul
 is from God alone.
"," Man begets his like, forasmuch as by his seminal power
 the matter is disposed for the reception of a certain species of form.
"," In the action of the adulterer, what is of nature is
 good; in this God concurs. But what there is of inordinate lust is
 evil; in this God does not concur.

579,"[I, Q. 118, Art. 3]
","Whether Human Souls Were Created Together at the Beginning of the
"," It would seem that human souls were created together at
 the beginning of the world. For it is written (Gen. 2:2): ""God rested
 Him from all His work which He had done."" This would not be true if He
 created new souls every day. Therefore all souls were created at the
 same time.
"," Further, spiritual substances before all others belong to the
 perfection of the universe. If therefore souls were created with the
 bodies, every day innumerable spiritual substances would be added to
 the perfection of the universe: consequently at the beginning the
 universe would have been imperfect. This is contrary to Gen. 2:2,
 where it is said that ""God ended"" all ""His work.""
"," Further, the end of a thing corresponds to its beginning. But
 the intellectual soul remains, when the body perishes. Therefore it
 began to exist before the body.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,," God is said to have rested on the seventh day, not from
 all work, since we read (John 5:17): ""My Father worketh until now"";
 but from the creation of any new genera and species, which may not
 have already existed in the first works. For in this sense, the souls
 which are created now, existed already, as to the likeness of the
 species, in the first works, which included the creation of Adam's
 soul.
"," Something can be added every day to the perfection of
 the universe, as to the number of individuals, but not as to the
 number of species.
"," That the soul remains without the body is due to the
 corruption of the body, which was a result of sin. Consequently it
 was not fitting that God should make the soul without the body from
 the beginning: for as it is written (Wis. 1:13, 16): ""God made not
 death . . . but the wicked with works and words have called it to
 them.""

580,"[I, Q. 119, Art. 1]
","Whether Some Part of the Food Is Changed into True Human Nature?
"," It would seem that none of the food is changed into true
 human nature. For it is written (Matt. 15:17): ""Whatsoever entereth
 into the mouth, goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the privy.""
 But what is cast out is not changed into the reality of human nature.
 Therefore none of the food is changed into true human nature.
"," Further, the Philosopher (De Gener. i, 5) distinguishes flesh
 belonging to the species from flesh belonging to ""matter""; and says
 that the latter ""comes and goes."" Now what is formed from food comes
 and goes. Therefore what is produced from food is flesh belonging to
 matter, not to the species. But what belongs to true human nature
 belongs to the species. Therefore the food is not changed into true
 human nature.
"," Further, the ""radical humor"" seems to belong to the reality
 of human nature; and if it be lost, it cannot be recovered, according
 to physicians. But it could be recovered if the food were changed
 into the humor. Therefore food is not changed into true human nature.
"," Further, if the food were changed into true human nature,
 whatever is lost in man could be restored. But man's death is due
 only to the loss of something. Therefore man would be able by taking
 food to insure himself against death in perpetuity.
"," Further, if the food is changed into true human nature, there
 is nothing in man which may not recede or be repaired: for what is
 generated in a man from his food can both recede and be repaired. If
 therefore a man lived long enough, it would follow that in the end
 nothing would be left in him of what belonged to him at the
 beginning. Consequently he would not be numerically the same man
 throughout his life; since for the thing to be numerically the same,
 identity of matter is necessary. But this is incongruous. Therefore
 the food is not changed into true human nature.
",,,,,,,,,,,,," Our Lord does not say that the ""whole"" of what enters
 into the mouth, but ""all""--because something from every kind of food
 is cast out into the privy. It may also be said that whatever is
 generated from food, can be dissolved by natural heat, and be cast
 aside through the pores, as Jerome expounds the passage.
"," By flesh belonging to the species, some have understood
 that which first receives the human species, which is derived from
 the begetter: this, they say, lasts as long as the individual does.
 By flesh belonging to the matter these understand what is generated
 from food: and this, they say, does not always remain, but as it
 comes so it goes. But this is contrary to the mind of Aristotle. For
 he says there, that ""just as in things which have their species in
 matter""--for instance, wood or stone--""so in flesh, there is
 something belonging to the species, and something belonging to
 matter."" Now it is clear that this distinction has no place in
 inanimate things, which are not generated seminally, or nourished.
 Again, since what is generated from food is united to, by mixing
 with, the body so nourished, just as water is mixed with wine, as the
 Philosopher says there by way of example: that which is added, and
 that to which it is added, cannot be different natures, since they
 are already made one by being mixed together. Therefore there is no
 reason for saying that one is destroyed by natural heat, while the
 other remains.
"," The ""radical humor"" is said to comprise whatever the
 virtue of the species is founded on. If this be taken away it cannot
 be renewed; as when a man's hand or foot is amputated. But the
 ""nutritive humor"" is that which has not yet received perfectly the
 specific nature, but is on the way thereto; such is the blood, and
 the like. Wherefore if such be taken away, the virtue of the species
 remains in its root, which is not destroyed.
"," Every virtue of a passible body is weakened by
 continuous action, because such agents are also patient. Therefore
 the transforming virtue is strong at first so as to be able to
 transform not only enough for the renewal of what is lost, but also
 for growth. Later on it can only transform enough for the renewal of
 what is lost, and then growth ceases. At last it cannot even do this;
 and then begins decline. In fine, when this virtue fails altogether,
 the animal dies. Thus the virtue of wine that transforms the water
 added to it, is weakened by further additions of water, so as to
 become at length watery, as the Philosopher says by way of example
 (De Gener. i, 5).
"," As the Philosopher says (De Gener. i, 5), when a
 certain matter is directly transformed into fire, then fire is said
 to be generated anew: but when matter is transformed into a fire
 already existing, then fire is said to be fed. Wherefore if the
 entire matter together loses the form of fire, and another matter
 transformed into fire, there will be another distinct fire. But if,
 while one piece of wood is burning, other wood is laid on, and so on
 until the first piece is entirely consumed, the same identical fire
 will remain all the time: because that which is added passes into
 what pre-existed. It is the same with living bodies, in which by
 means of nourishment that is renewed which was consumed by natural
 heat.

581,"[I, Q. 119, Art. 2]
","Whether the Semen Is Produced from Surplus Food?
"," It would seem that the semen is not produced from the
 surplus food, but from the substance of the begetter. For Damascene
 says (De Fide Orth. i, 8) that ""generation is a work of nature,
 producing, from the substance of the begetter, that which is
 begotten."" But that which is generated is produced from the semen.
 Therefore the semen is produced from the substance of the begetter.
"," Further, the son is like his father, in respect of that which
 he receives from him. But if the semen from which something is
 generated, is produced from the surplus food, a man would receive
 nothing from his grandfather and his ancestors in whom the food never
 existed. Therefore a man would not be more like to his grandfather or
 ancestors, than to any other men.
"," Further, the food of the generator is sometimes the flesh of
 cows, pigs and suchlike. If therefore, the semen were produced from
 surplus food, the man begotten of such semen would be more akin to
 the cow and the pig, than to his father or other relations.
"," Further, Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. x, 20) that we were in
 Adam ""not only by seminal virtue, but also in the very substance of
 the body."" But this would not be, if the semen were produced from
 surplus food. Therefore the semen is not produced therefrom.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,," Generation is from the substance of the begetter in
 animals and plants, inasmuch as the semen owes its virtue to the
 form of the begetter, and inasmuch as it is in potentiality to the
 substance.
"," The likeness of the begetter to the begotten is on
 account not of the matter, but of the form of the agent that
 generates its like. Wherefore in order for a man to be like his
 grandfather, there is no need that the corporeal seminal matter
 should have been in the grandfather; but that there be in the semen a
 virtue derived from the soul of the grandfather through the father.
 In like manner the third objection is answered. For kinship is not in
 relation to matter, but rather to the derivation of the forms.
"," These words of Augustine are not to be understood as
 though the immediate seminal virtue, or the corporeal substance from
 which this individual was formed were actually in Adam: but so that
 both were in Adam as in principle. For even the corporeal matter,
 which is supplied by the mother, and which he calls the corporeal
 substance, is originally derived from Adam: and likewise the active
 seminal power of the father, which is the immediate seminal virtue
 (in the production) of this man.
